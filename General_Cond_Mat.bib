  abstract  = {In this paper, we review theoretical and experimental research on rare region effects at quantum phase transitions in disordered itinerant electron systems. After summarizing a few basic concepts about phase transitions in the presence of quenched randomness, we introduce the idea of rare regions and discuss their importance. We then analyze in detail the different phenomena that can arise at magnetic quantum phase transitions in disordered metals, including quantum Griffiths singularities, smeared phase transitions, and cluster-glass formation. For each scenario, we discuss the resulting phase diagram and summarize the behavior of various observables. We then review several recent experiments that provide examples of these rare region phenomena. We conclude by discussing limitations of current approaches and open questions.},

Nevertheless, with the use of some general scaling assumptions we have developed a procedure by means of which we can analyse the equilibrium critical scattering in these systems for H = 0, the random-exchange Ising model, and, more importantly, for H >0, the random-field Ising model. Our new fitting approach, unlike the more conventional techniques, allows us to obtain the universal critical behaviour exponents and amplitude ratios as well as the critical line shapes. We discuss the technique as applied to Fe 0.93 Zn 0.07 F 2 . The general technique, however, should be applicable to other problems where the scattering line shapes are not well understood but scaling is expected to hold.},

supports a gapless Goldstone mode associated with the broken rotational symmetry. We
consider a nematic Fermi liquid of fermions carrying two internal quantum numbers that,
for example, may represent the layer degree of freedom of a bilayer system. It is
found that the effective interaction mediated by a collective mode gives rise to a
pairing instability of the underlying fermions under certain conditions, leading
to the conclusion that the nematic order could be useful for superconductivity.},

  abstract  = {Correlated electron fluids can exhibit a startling array of complex phases, among which one of the more surprising is the electron nematic, a translationally invariant metallic phase with a spontaneously generated spatial anisotropy. Classical nematics generally occur in liquids of rod-like molecules; given that electrons are point like, the initial theoretical motivation for contemplating electron nematics came from thinking of the electron fluid as a quantum melted electron crystal, rather than a strongly interacting descendent of a Fermi gas. Dramatic transport experiments in ultra-clean quantum Hall systems in 1999 and in Sr3Ru2O7 in a strong magnetic field in 2007 established that such phases exist in nature. In this article, we briefly review the theoretical considerations governing nematic order, summarize the quantum Hall and Sr3Ru2O7 experiments that unambiguously establish the existence of this phase, and survey some of the current evidence for such a phase in the cuprate and Fe-based high temperature superconductors.},

  abstract  = {Many interesting materials, including various high-temperature superconductors, exhibit a low-temperature {\textquotedblleft}electron nematic{\textquotedblright} phase in which the electronic properties spontaneously break the rotational symmetry of the crystal. A nematic quantum critical point (QCP) marks the zero-temperature phase transition from a nematic ground state to a symmetric state as a function of a macroscopic nonthermal parameter. Here, we examine appropriate general means to tune Ising nematic systems to a QCP and in particular show that shear strain is a powerful tuning parameter. Moreover, we identify 4f ferroquadrupolar order as a realization of Ising nematic order and argue that it provides a promising platform for fundamental studies of metallic QCPs in the laboratory.The paradigmatic example of a continuous quantum phase transition is the transverse field Ising ferromagnet. In contrast to classical critical systems, whose properties depend only on symmetry and the dimension of space, the nature of a quantum phase transition also depends on the dynamics. In the transverse field Ising model, the order parameter is not conserved, and increasing the transverse field enhances quantum fluctuations until they become strong enough to restore the symmetry of the ground state. Ising pseudospins can represent the order parameter of any system with a twofold degenerate broken-symmetry phase, including electronic nematic order associated with spontaneous point-group symmetry breaking. Here, we show for the representative example of orbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet that an orthogonal strain or a perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of the transverse field, thereby providing a practical route for tuning appropriate materials to a quantum critical point. While the transverse fields are conjugate to seemingly unrelated order parameters, their nontrivial commutation relations with the nematic order parameter, which can be represented by a Berry-phase term in an effective field theory, intrinsically intertwine the different order parameters.},

  abstract  = {The most striking fact about rare earth chemistry is the extraordinary similarity in the properties of all the elements. They all appear to be group IIIA elements of the periodic table like yttrium (Y). This arises of course from the fact that the 4f shell of electrons is being filled at this point in the periodic table, while the number of outer valence electrons remains unchanged. The 4f electrons are closely bound inside the outer closed shells and therefore play a small role in chemical bonding. On the other hand the f electrons with their high angular momentum are responsible for the magnetic properties of rare earth materials and these vary strikingly from atom to atom since the interelectronic interactions on the atom give many states which change in detail as the number of 4f electrons changes. In addition they give many low-lying energy levels which may be investigated spectroscopically.},

  abstract  = {The author presents a physically realizable random field model in the form of dilute crystals undergoing structural phase transitions, with the impurities generating a random strain field. The mode softening that occurs at the transition is anisotropic. The author shows how this anisotropic mode softening reduces the upper critical dimension from 6 to 4. The author performs an in -expansion at three dimensions about the upper critical dimension, from which the author obtains static critical exponents which, to O( in ), are equal to those corresponding to the pure three-dimensional Ising model. The crossover behaviour is described. Elastic long-range forces reduce the upper critical roughening dimension from 5 to 3. The author finds that even at the upper critical roughening dimension of 3, domain wall roughness is not eliminated. This is due to anisotropic shape effects in the domain walls, induced by the anisotropic long-range forces.},

From the analysis of the experimental results it follows that the electron processes provide the main contribution to the thermal transport in the range above 0.3Tc while phonon contribution is decisive, due to the defect structure, only below this temperature. The values of energy gap 2Δ = (2.15 to 2.3) kTc are found by three independent methods. Further, the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusivity is presented in the temperature range above 4 K.},

This can be attributed to low energy excitations which are created during irradiation and which are associated with Al impurities. The thermal conductivity is reduced after irradiation. Below 4K the additional thermal resistivity varies asT−1.5. The phonon scattering by radiation-induced excitations in α-quartz is weak compared to phonon scattering by two level systems (TLS) in vitreous silica.},

  abstract  = {It has been conjectured that many properties of highly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductivity, may arise from proximity to a metallic quantum critical point. However, the nature of quantum critical phenomena in metals is incompletely understood. Using numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo methods, we simulated a model that can be tuned through a metallic quantum critical point and observed behaviors that are strikingly reminiscent of experiments. Among these phenomena are high-temperature superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid behavior of the electron Green function, and {\textquotedblleft}bad metal{\textquotedblright} behavior of the electrical conductivity.Using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo, we compute the properties of a lattice model with spin 12 itinerant electrons tuned through a quantum phase transition to an Ising nematic phase. The nematic fluctuations induce superconductivity with a broad dome in the superconducting Tc enclosing the nematic quantum critical point. For temperatures above Tc, we see strikingly non-Fermi liquid behavior, including a {\textquotedblleft}nodal{\textendash}antinodal dichotomy{\textquotedblright} reminiscent of that seen in several transition metal oxides. In addition, the critical fluctuations have a strong effect on the low-frequency optical conductivity, resulting in behavior consistent with {\textquotedblleft}bad metal{\textquotedblright} phenomenology.},
