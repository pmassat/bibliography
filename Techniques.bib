  abstract =  {This chapter discusses the methods of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and of Mössbauer effect or nuclear gamma resonance (NGR) spectroscopy for the study of the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of rare-earth metals, alloys, and compounds. A variety of other nuclear techniques based on nuclear orientation (NO) and perturbed angular correlation (PAC) of gamma radiation are discussed that are gaining increasing significance in solid state investigations. To serve as a basis for the discussion of experimental results, the natural abundances, spins, effective gyromagnetic ratios, and electric quadrupole moments of the ground states of those nuclei, rare-earth and non-rare earth, significant for the study of rare-earth metals, alloys, and compounds, are listed in the tables in the chapter. The principal interactions that contribute to the nuclear spin relaxation times in NMR experiments are briefly considered, and the connections among these and the parameters characterizing the steady-state spectrum are discussed in the chapter.},

For a concentration, x, of missing interactions in the simple-square Ising model the author finds -T c -1 dT c /dx mod x=0 =1.329 compared with the mean-field value of one. If the interactions are independent random variable with a width delta J/J identical to epsilon , the result is -T c -1 dT c /d epsilon 2 mod epsilon =0 =0.312 compared with the mean-field results of zero. An approximation yields the specific heat in the critical regime as C approximately C 0 /(1+x gamma 2 C 0 ), where gamma is a constant and C 0 is the unperturbed specific heat at a renormalized temperature. Thus, the specific heat divergence is broadened over a temperature interval Delta T, with Delta T/T c approximately x (1 alpha )/, where alpha is the critical exponent for the specific heat, and a maximum value of order x -1 is attained. Heuristic arguments show that this smoothing effect occurs if alpha >0.},

The phonon self-energy is calculated in the one-loop approximation including electron-phonon interaction and impurity scattering. The wave vector dispersion and the temperature dependence of the phonon self-energy are calculated for two model Eliashberg spectral functions. It is shown that a strong electron-phonon interaction diminishes the nonadiabatic renormalization of a phonon frequency and shifts the maximum of the linewidth to the values of qvF higher than it follows for Landau damping of noninteracting electrons. The vertex corrections are studied for a system with isotropic impurity scattering. It is shown that they can give in some cases a serious qualitative contribution to the nonadiabatic renormalzation of phonon frequencies and linewidths.},

The temperature change associated with the EC effect can be substantial, far exceeding those observed in well-known electrocaloric and magnetocaloric materials. The major driver of the EC effect is the entropy change of transformation. Historically the EC effect under superelasticity has been studied at mainly 25°C. The current paper considers six SMAs across a variety of test temperatures, focusing not only on the EC cooling capability but also on three important factors for practical application: the role of stress/thermal hysteresis, Md temperature, and fatigue.},

The eCE can be characterized by the adiabatic temperature change or the isothermal entropy change (both as a function of applied stress/strain). To get these quantities, the evaluation of the eCE can be done using either direct methods, where one measures (adiabatic) temperature changes or indirect methods where one can measure the stress--strain--temperature characteristics of the materials and from these deduce the adiabatic temperature and isothermal entropy changes. The former can be done using the basic thermodynamic relations, i.e. Maxwell relation and Clausius--Clapeyron equation. This paper further presents basic thermodynamic properties of shape memory materials, such as the adiabatic temperature change, isothermal entropy change and total entropy--temperature diagrams (all as a function of temperature and applied stress/strain) of two groups of materials (Ni--Ti and Cu--Zn--Al alloys) obtained using indirect methods through phenomenological modelling and Maxwell relation. In the last part of the paper, the basic definition of the efficiency of the elastocaloric thermodynamic cycle (coefficient of performance) is defined and discussed.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Elastocaloric (EC) effect refers to the rapid cooling in shape memory alloys (SMAs) during reverse transformation from martensite to austenite under adiabatic conditions. We present a very comprehensive study of the EC response far extending the existing literature by studying the effect of loading states (tension and compression), long-term cycling, strain localization, and deformation temperatures in several SMAs including CuZnAl, NiTi, NiTiCu, Ni2FeGa and NiTiHf13.3. We found a temperature change of 14.2 °C in CuZnAl, 18.2 °C in NiTi, 15.2 °C in NiTiCu, 13.5 °C in Ni2FeGa, and 6.95 °C in NiTiHf13.3 upon reverse transformation depending on the entropy change (as high as 60 J/kg K), the stress hysteresis, the inhomogeneity of the transformation and the number of superelastic cycles. A gradual deterioration of the EC effect in tension develops, while in compression the EC effect can be sustained much longer (in excess of 104 cycles). The Ni2FeGa SMAs possess an operational EC temperature window of nearly 200 °C, which is the widest among the chosen SMAs. With over one hundred experiments reported in one study, this paper represents an authoritative summary of the EC capabilities of a wide range of SMAs.},

The results as functions of longitudinal and transverse dimension ratios are listed in tables and plotted in figures. The three special cases of b/spl Gt/(ca)/sup 1/2/, b/spl Lt/(ca)/sup 1/2/, and a=b are analyzed together with the general case, to quantitatively show the validity of approximate formulas for special cases. N/sub f,m/ of prisms with any given values of /spl chi/ may be estimated to an accuracy about 10%, since 1) N/sub f,m/ of prisms with a=b are very near those of cylinders, for which the /spl chi/ dependence has been calculated quite completely; 2) the /spl chi/ dependence of the transverse N/sub f,m/ of prisms with b=/spl infin/ (rectangular bars) have recently been calculated completely; and 3) N/sub f,m/(X=/spl infin/) for prisms of great longitudinal dimension ratios are close to N of the corresponding ellipsoids. Thus, the existing very incomplete results can be used in some cases satisfactorily, although much work has to be done before the actual /spl chi/ dependence of N/sub f,m/ is available as it is for cylinders.},

Using a technique developed by the authors, the demagnetizing factor resulting from the simulations match very well with experimental results for several series of samples with various geometries. The simulation technique developed by this project was also used for a spherical magnet using various field conditions, which has further proved the accuracy of this technique, whose results agree precisely with the theoretical analyses and mathematical calculation. Such simulation provides advantages over other methods including mathematical calculation and experimental measurement. Since any geometry with any dimensions can be simulated using the electromagnetic field simulation, the simulated results of “N” values can be stored in a data bank for any application using open-circuit measurements in the future.},

We treat the general situation in which both magnetic and quadrupolar fluctuations are present and consider three cases differing in their initial conditions: (1) a short radio-frequency pulse is applied selectively to one of the transitions; (2) all lines are saturated at once; (3) a selected line is saturated by continuous waves or by means of a long comb of pulses. Exact solutions are presented for spin I = 1 and I = 3/2, whereas for spin I = 5/2, exact solutions are given for special cases and approximate solutions for the general case. The spin I = 7/2 case is treated for magnetic fluctuations only. The detailed analysis reveals that the form of the recovery law is surprisingly insensitive to an additional relaxation channel, e.g. quadrupolar fluctuations in the presence of predominantly magnetic fluctuations or vice versa.},

  abstract  = {Certain processing-related flaws in cold isostatically pressed ceramic powder compacts may arise from the delayed burn-out of organic binders until the sintering temperature is approached, although the isostatic compaction technique usually gives a higher and much more uniform green density than the conventional die compaction technique. For the 3 mol{\%} Y2O3-doped zirconia powder in which 3 wt{\%} PEG 1500 was introduced, the sintered density and sintering shrinkage were found to decrease in a near linear manner with increasing isostatic compaction pressure. The processing-related defects were identified as intergranular pores (1--5 $\mu$m). It is considered that these processing-related defects are a consequence of incomplete organic burn-out at low and intermediate temperatures in the heating-up period and the swelling of intergranular pores associated with the burn-out of residual organic binders at temperatures close to the sintering temperature. A higher calcination temperature and an extended calcination dwell time may be required to eliminate the organic residuals in the isostatically pressed ceramic powder compacts than in the conventional die-pressed samples.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT A review is given of progress in the theoretical and experimental study of the Raman effect in crystals during the past ten years. Attention is given to the theory of those properties of long-wavelength lattice vibrations in both cubic and uniaxial crystals which can be studied by Raman scattering. In particular the phenomena observed in the Raman scattering from crystals which lack a centre of inversion are related to the theory. The angular variations of the scattering by any type of lattice vibration in a crystal having any symmetry can be easily calculated using a complete tabulation of the Raman tensor. Recent measurements of first-order lattice vibration spectra are listed. A discussion of Brillouin scattering is included. The relation of second-order Raman spectra to critical points in the lattice vibration density of states is discussed, and measurements of the second-order spectra of diamond and the alkali halides are reviewed. The theory and experimental results for Raman scattering by electronic levels of ions in crystals are examined, and proposals for Raman scattering by spin waves, electronic excitations across the superconductive gap and by plasmons are collected together. Finally, the prospects for applying lasers as sources for Raman spectroscopy are discussed, and progress in the new technique of stimulated Raman scattering is reviewed.},

In this paper some recent improvements in the analysis of magnetic neutron powder diffraction data are discussed. After an introduction to the subject, the main formulas governing the analysis of the Bragg magnetic scattering are summarized and shortly discussed. Next, we discuss the method of profile fitting without a structural model to get precise integrated intensities and refine the propagation vector(s) of the magnetic structure. The simulated annealing approach for magnetic structure determination is briefly discussed and, finally, some features of the program FullProf concerning the magnetic structure refinement are presented and discussed. The different themes are illustrated with simple examples.},

After more than 20 years of use, close-range photogrammetry, now for the most part entirely digital, has become an accepted, powerful and readily available technique for engineers, scientists and others who wish to utilise images to make accurate 3D measurements of complex objects. Here they will find the photogrammetric fundamentals, details of system hardware and software, and broad range of real-world applications in order to achieve this. Following the introduction, the book provides fundamental mathematics covering subjects such as image orientation, digital imaging processing and 3D reconstruction methods, as well as a discussion of imaging technology, including targeting and illumination, and its implementation in hardware and software. It concludes with an overview of photogrammetric solutions for typical applications in engineering, manufacturing, medical science, architecture, archaeology and other fields.},
