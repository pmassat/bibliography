  abstract  = {The occurrence of a quadrupolar ordering within the γ orthorhombic symmetry at 7 K in TmAu 2 (MoSi 2 -type tetragonal structure) was recently discovered. The existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering around 3 K in the quadrupolar phase leads to complex magnetic phase diagrams in the ( H , T ) plane. From neutron diffraction studies on a single crystal, a magnetic structure is determined for each of the five phases observed for a magnetic field applied along the twofold orthorhombic axis. The complexity of the phase diagram can be understood as the result of a conflict, under field, between quadrupoles and antiferromagnetic moments, associated with a rather degenerated maximum for the J ( Q ) Fourier transform of the exchange couplings. Then classical arrangements perpendicular to the field and Ising-type behaviours are observed; in the latter case, the incommensurate nature of the magnetic interactions leads to behaviours of devil's staircase type.},

The ground state is a crystal-field doublet with a uniaxial g-factor of g c =13.8+or-0.5. The spectroscopic measurements and the direct optical observation of domain structure both indicate that LiHoF 4 orders ferromagnetically parallel to the crystallographic c-axis at T c =1.52+or-0.01K. The ordering is caused by magnetic dipole interaction, and the formation of domains of small demagnetizing factor is essential.},

The importance of the latter as a method of describing the resonance results is emphasized, the discussion proceeding in terms which are, as far as possible, independent of the underlying theory. The ions of the iron (3d) group and the rare earth (4f) group are then surveyed individually in terms of the spin-Hamiltonian. The influence of exchange interaction is treated in a separate chapter, and the review ends with a brief account of resonance in gases and other special compounds.},

The crystals are tetragonal, four molecules per unit cell, but all V 5+ sites and all Ln 3+ sites are magnetically equivalent. Measurements are made with applied fields parallel and perpendicular to the tetragonal axis, and fitted to the spin-Hamiltonian H=- gamma //h(cross)B z I z - gamma perpendicular to h(cross)(B x I x +B y I y )+P(I z 2 - 1 / 3 I(I+1)). Values for the paramagnetic shifts are used to deduce the local fields at both the V 5+ and Ln 3+ sites. These fields are compared with the dipolar values, from which the magnitude of the transferred hyperfine interaction at the V 5+ sites is deduced, together with estimates of the exchange interaction between the Ln 3+ ions.

Below a critical temperature TD = 6.13(3) K, a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion splits the ground doublet, which produces domains with principal axes [110], [11̄0]. The behaviour of the three lowest levels has been studied by using high resolution optical absorption spectroscopy with magnetic fields up to 9 T along the [001] axis and in the (001) plane. Enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance of the single stable isotope 169Tm has also been observed in these directions. Parallel to the c-axis the results confirm that from 1.6 to 4.2 K the magnitude of the Jahn-Teller splitting follows mean field theory to within 0.2 %. New values of the parameters give good agreement with mean field theory, but in the (001) plane the n.m.r. and optical measurements disagree with each other and with calculations based on the crystal field parameters of Bingham et al. (1984), which indicates that other interactions may be present.},

The nuclear magnetic moments have been determined with an accuracy of about 0.01 to 1%. A brief historical account of optical and magnetic resonance measurements is presented in the chapter. Before the advent of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, nuclear spins and moments were determined almost entirely by optical spectroscopy. When a hyperfine multiplet is observed with good resolution, the value of the nuclear spin I is obtained immediately from the multiplicity, provided that I < J. The chapter further explains atomic beam measurements. The accuracy obtained by the use of beams of atoms, combined with magnetic resonance, is enormously greater than that available from optical experiments prior to the advent of the laser. Atomic beam, triple resonance is also explained in the chapter.},

In the main, most of this work has been carried out at temperatures down to 1 K or so (e.g. Gehring and Gehring 1975). In this review NMRON, and other low temperature experiments in the mK regime, are presented and discussed. It will be argued that the low temperature properties of these compounds are just as interesting as their high temperature counterparts. In general, the nuclear and electronic wavefunctions become intermixed, leading to a variety of interesting physical effects, such as enhanced nuclear magnetism, quadrupolar induced intermediate state re-orientation etc. These effects have, in turn, spawned new methods for the investigation of magnetic structures, and thermometric detection of NMR both by internal and external thermometers. Several experiments are suggested, including magnetic refrigeration, M&ouml;ssbauer, EPR in the &#x2248;30 GHz range, in addition to thermometric NMR and NMRON.},

High-quality powders of the zircon-type MV O4 vanadates were prepared by a homogeneous coprecipitation in molten urea. The zircon structure has space group symmetry I 41/amd, Z = 4, with 3 atoms occupying the asymmetric unit. In all, 22 parameters were refined with final agreement values of Rp = 0.0313-0.0421, Rwp = 0.0361-0.0511, and G-of-F = 1.210-1.962. The average V-O bond length for all of the MVO4 samples is 1.709(2) Å, and the V-O distance exhibits a small systematic shortening with decreasing M atom size. The oxygen positional parameters, the cell dimensions, and the M-O distances vary systematically with the metal-ion atomic number. The anisotropic thermal motion of the oxygen atom has the largest amplitude normal to the shared polyhedral edge between the VO4 tetrahedron and MO8 bisdisphenoid. Empirical relations are given for the cell dimensions and oxygen atom position as a function of the size of the lanthanide ion which can be used to estimate structural parameters for other zircon-type lanthanide vanadate end-members and vanadate solid solutions.},

The optical conductivity function was obtained via Kramers-Kronig analysis. We observed a dirty metal-like behavior at room temperature and the opening of a gap of 70 meV at low temperature. The results of a group theoretical analysis of the lattice vibrational modes are presented and compared to the experimental data. Of the five optical phonons expected for this material only four have been observed in the far-infrared region.},

  abstract =  {The low frequency collective modes of protons are calculated for ferrroelectric crystals of the KH2 PO4 type taking into account the tunneling frequency and a simplified interaction between proton sites. They give rise to a band of frequencies which could be observed by inelastic scattering of neutrons. (In the deuterated salts, on the other hand the band is very narrow and the excitations are only weakly coupled to the neutrons). When the temperature is raised, there is a decrease in frequency and a broadening for each mode. Finally, in the paraelectric state, one expects a broad neutron spectrum from the hydrogen compound, but only quasielastic scattering from the deuterium compound.

  abstract  = {The Ising model (exchange constant J) with a transverse field Gamma can be regarded as a simple model of hydrogen bonded ferroelectrics and of certain magnetic systems. The transition temperature T C decreases as Gamma increases and falls to zero at a critical field Gamma C . This transition is studied in the quadratic and simple cubic lattices with nearest neighbour interactions by a power series expansion of the susceptibility at high T up to fifth order in (J/kT) to all orders in ( Gamma /kT). The coefficients are calculated by diagram counting and time ordering perturbation methods. The critical Gamma against T curve is derived and the critical exponent gamma of the susceptibility. This appears to vary smoothly with Gamma but it is argued that this is an artifact due to the use of a short series and that the critical exponents are probably independent of Gamma as long as T C remains finite but change discontinuity at T C =0.},

  abstract  = {The rare-earth crystals DyVO4, DyAsO4 and TbVO4 undergo structural phase transitions at 14, 12 and 34 K respectively induced by a cooperative Jahn-Teller effect. An experimental investigation of the phase changes has been made using Raman scattering methods. For purposes of comparison, the Raman spectra of DyPO4, YVO4 and GdVO4 (which do not undergo phase transitions) have also been measured. A detailed theory of the phase transitions has been developed which accounts for the electronic and vibrational Raman spectra. The lowest four electronic levels of Dy3+ and Tb3+ are treated in a pseudospin formalism, and the theory is discussed in terms of mixed phonon and pseudo-spin excitations. The singly degenerate κ ≈ 0 optic phonons are not measurably affected by the transitions, but splittings of up to 20 cm-1 developed in the doubly degenerate Eg phonon modes in the Raman spectra owing to anharmonic couplings with the electronic states. Splittings are also observed in the lowest electronic levels of the rate earth ions below the transition temperature; these electronic modes effectively constitute the soft mode which causes the transitions to occur. A molecular field model is first used in the theoretical analysis. The equations of motion of the coupled excitations are then found and the energies, line widths and dispersion of the mixed excitations are discussed. The connexion between the static strain and the acoustic phonon mode coupling is investigated, and a thermodynamic treatment of the elastic constants is given. From the Raman data, it appears that in TbVO4 the acoustic mode coupling is stronger than the optic mode coupling.},

It discusses the retarding effects that deal with the various physical effects caused by the crystal field splitting of the RE. The chapter discusses inelastic neutron scattering that is useful for studying the excitations of a system of interacting RE-ions. Possible new effects resulting from interactions other than the isotropic exchange interaction are also discussed in the chapter. There are a large number of theoretical and experimental investigations available that deal with cooperative phenomena in lattices of CEF-split ions. These cooperative phenomena are discussed that result from the mutual interactions among the RE-ions. The chapter focuses on two particular types of effective ion–ion interactions—namely, the isotropic exchange and the quadrupolar Coulomb interaction. The chapter discusses influence of impurities in lattices of crystal-field split ions.},

A molecular field theory for this Hamiltonian predicts a second order phase transition and a dependence of the ground state splitting on stress. Contributions of phonon modes and strain can be distinguished by a comparison of the elastic constants and the parameters derived from the stress dependence of the ground state splitting. A correction to these molecular field results is derived by accounting for fluctuations. The effects of a magnetic field are investigated in the molecular field approximation; it is found that if the field is applied in the basal plane simultaneously with the stress at low temperatures, different distortions can be stabilized. The form of the first order phase boundary for these distortions is derived and an analogy is drawn between this â€˜pseudospin flopâ€™ transition and antiferromagnetic spin flop.},

The relation of these interactions with quadrupolar interactions and magnetostriction is included. The methods of solution of the hamiltonians lead to an understanding of the electronic states, the phonon spectrum and the mixed normal modes. The wide variety of experimental techniques used on this problem are reviewed in detail and the results are compared with theoretical expressions whenever possible. The application of external stress and magnetic field is of particular significance in the case of the rare earth compounds, because they can product effects which are larger than the low-temperature spontaneous effects.},

Specific heat measurements, spectroscopic and birefringence data yielded the transition temperatures. The phase diagram of the mixed system may be interpreted as a superposition of the phase diagram of diluted TbVO 4 and that of diluted DyVO 4 . At high concentrations of one of the rare-earth ions the crystals distort like the respective pure substances, whereas at medium concentrations x approximately=0.4 a superposition of the distortion types is observed.

Because of the angular dependence of the Nd3+ resonance line position, we suppose the presence of structural defects like twins and mosaic structure. Moreover, for the first time the ESR spectrum of V4+ in YVO4 is reported.},

In this paper we have reported the measurement of the real part of permittivity and loss tangent of YVO4 crystal in the temperature range 15--295 K at a frequency of 16.3 GHz. We have used the dielectric post resonator technique for the microwave characterisation of the YVO4 dielectric rod. The multifrequency Transmission Mode Q-Factor (TMQF) technique has been used for data processing and hence precise values of permittivity and loss tangent are achieved. Easily machineable YVO4 is characterized by low losses at microwave frequencies. At temperature of 15 K and frequency of 16.3 GHz the permittivity was 9.23 and loss tangent was 2 {\texttimes} 10âˆ’ 5. YVO4 is identified as a potential candidate to replace expensive Sapphire in many microwave applications.},

We have shown that interstitial interaction makes the ground state of the crystal correspond to a certain packing of ``frozen'' (in contrast with the case of an isolated center) local Jahn---Teller distortions. With increasing temperature the correlations of the Jahn---Teller distortions become weaker, and a transition to a disordered phase occurs. This structural phase transition associated with the cooperative Jahn---Teller effect is naturally determined by the lowest electronic state of the lattice sites and by the character of their vibronic coupling. In this chapter we discuss the main types of conceptually different situations produced by the cooperative Jahn---Teller effect and examine the elastic anomalies accompanying this structural phase transition.},

The less intense side bands are caused by a large number of exchange interactions and the analysis is less clear.},

  abstract  = {Vanadium−cerium oxide catalysts, with different V/Ce atomic ratios, were prepared using vanadyl oxalate (VOC2O4) impregnated on ceria (CeO2) as precursors. Subsequently, the freshly prepared solids were calcined under a flow of dried air at different temperatures from 400 to 800 °C. These solids have been characterized with different techniques: Raman spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TG-DSC), specific area measurements (BET), EPR, and solid-state 51V MAS NMR. Different vanadium species in the vanadium−cerium oxide catalysts have been evidenced. Polymeric V−O−V chains, vanadium tetrahedral surface species, and V2O5 phase are stabilized mainly when solids are calcined in the temperature range 400−500 °C. Their formation also depends on the vanadium content. For higher calcinations temperatures (≥500°C), CeO2 reacts with vanadium (V) species to form a CeVO4 mixed phase. Further to that formation, a single electron is trapped in an oxygen vacancy in the CeVO4 phase and can be considered as its probe.},

Both the magnetoelastic couplings and the quadrupolar pair interactions are here determined by means of third-order magnetic susceptibility and parastriction measurements. The existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering around 3 K in the quadrupolar phase leads to complex magnetic phase diagrams in the ( H , T ) plane, which have been established along the main crystallographic directions of the tetragonal cell and appear to result from the balance between magnetic and quadrupolar interactions.},

For the B 2g mode the Jahn-Teller coupling constants were found to be lambda /k B =-1.0K and mu /k B =3.2K. The ratio of mu to lambda is in good agreement with the molecular-field value of about -3. For the B 1g mode lambda '/k B =-0.1K and mu '/k B =0.35K; mu '/ lambda ' approximately=-3.5. From the critical behaviour of c 66 , the critical index gamma was found to be 1.00+or-0.02. Measurements were also performed on the mixed crystal Tm 0.82 Lu 0.18 VO 4 , and from the field dependence of the elastic constant 1 / 2 (c 11 -c 12 ), the importance of random strains in this dilute TmVO 4 system has been confirmed.},

The addition of hyperfine and magnetic interactions is reviewed, and the use of magnetic-splitting data to improve crystal-field fitting is discussed. The development of the modeling of transition intensities, both for transitions between crystal-field levels, and transitions between J multiplets, is reviewed. The superposition model is presented as an analysis technique for both crystal-field and transition-intensity parametrizations. Developments in ab initio calculations, and their possible impact on the field, are discussed.},

The principle of MR obeys the magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which is based on the effect caused by a magnetic field on the materials that bear the property of varying the magnetic entropy, as well as its temperature, when varying the magnetic field. This article revises the MCE, its theory and thermodynamics. It discusses the properties that must be met by the magnetocaloric materials as well as those most suitable for room temperature MR and those displaying a promising future. Finally, a presentation and description of the Carnot, Brayton, Ericsson, AMR and cascading MR cycles is given with a view to establishing selection criteria based on their performances.},

Brillouin scattering measurements on DyVO 4 show that the elastic constant (c 11 - c 12 ) falls to zero at T D . The electron lattice interaction which drives the transition in this material is predominantly of short range and a cluster theory is used to interpret the measurements. The elastic constant c 66 of TbVO 4 also has an anomaly. It falls to zero at T D when measured at ultrasonic frequencies but only falls to a finite value when measured at the higher frequencies used in Brillouin scattering. This frequency dependence of the elastic constants is explained using both thermodynamic and microscopic theories.},

The coefficients in the expansion in K= beta J are finite polynomials in lambda =(h 2 ) av /J 2 . The authors derive the series up to seventh order in K for both gaussian and +or-H distributions of the fields. Two different methods are used to generate the series, and exact relations are derived which relate some of the coefficients to those of the susceptibility series for the pure model. The Dlog Pade analysis of the series confirms that d=6 is the upper critical dimensionality. The results are consistent with the absence of a ferromagnetic phase for d=2, and they are not inconsistent with a possible transition for d=3.},

  abstract  = {The free energy, magnetizations, susceptibilities, specific heat and entropy of the Ising model in a transverse field Gamma are calculated as functions of temperature and field by expanding in ascending powers of the high-density parameter 1/z. For each of these quantities the leading-order term (molecular-field theory) is written down and the first-order corrections, proportional to (1/z) 1 , are derived and described. Spin wave and spin fluctuation effects occur in the first-order corrections. These include zero-point terms and linear spin wave effects as well as effects arising from the temperature and field dependence of the spin wave energies. These latter effects are particularly important at the critical temperature T c ( Gamma ) where the spin wave energy vanishes. This results in a first-order specific heat contribution showing a change from exponential to T 3 temperature dependence when both T and T c ( Gamma ) are small. The zero-point terms are directly measurable in, for example, the curvature of the transverse magnetization as a function of Gamma at very low temperatures.},

  abstract  = {A brief review is first made of systems for which the spin-1/2 Ising model in a transverse field provides a useful description (insulating magnetic systems, order-disorder ferroelectrics, cooperative Jahn-Teller systems and other systems with 'pseudo-spin'- phonon interactions). A perturbation expansion is then developed which provides for all temperatures an approximate description of the model. The perturbation series is classified with respect to the small parameter 1/z, where z is the number of psins interacting with a given spin; this generates the molecular-field approximation and the random-phase approximation as the lowest-order description of the thermodynamic functions and correlation functions respectively. The leading-order approximations for the correlation functions, susceptibilities and spectral functions are discussed in detail. The formalism, which is the first application of such techniques to systems with varying magnetization direction, provides a basis for subsequent higher-order calculations of the free energy and correlation functions.},

In this work we present the thermopower S of two chromelâ€“AuFe0.07% thermocouples over an extended temperature range from 1.5K to 200K in magnetic fields up to 7T. For low temperatures T<4K we find a sizeable field dependence of S even in small fields. Furthermore, a field of 7T affects the thermopower considerably up to 200K. Thus, our data demonstrate a significant field dependence of the thermopower of chromelâ€“AuFe0.07% thermocouples in an extended temperature and field range compared to previous works.},

The calculated results show that the covalencies of Re−O bonds are increasing slightly from La to Lu and that the covalencies of V−O bonds in crystals are decreasing slightly from La to Lu. The linear expansion coefficients decrease progressively from LaVO4 to LuVO4; on the contrary, the bulk moduli increase progressively. Our calculated results are in good agreement with some experimental values for linear expansion coefficients and bulk moduli.},

They were assigned according to the group theory in terms of the internal modes of the VO4 tetrahedron and the external modes of the YxGd1−x(VO4) lattice. No appreciable changes in the phonon wavenumbers were observed for Yb:GdVO4 (Yb=0.008, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, and 0.035), indicating that the force fields in the GdVO4 lattice are not strongly altered by Yb doping at the Gd site. However, most of the phonon wavenumbers in the systems (Nd,Yb):YxGd1−x(VO4) shifts upwards (one-phonon-like behavior) when Y replaces for Gd.},

The predicted polarization characteristics of all the emission lines under discussion are in complete agreement with those observed in experiments by other authors, and the emission lines with highest or comparatively high calculated intensities correspond to the laser emission lines that have been realized. In these calculations, the effect of seventh-order odd crystal field on the emission intensities was first omitted and then estimated by the method suggested by Judd in 1962. It turned out that this effect should be taken into account explicitly and cannot be completely made up only by multiplying a factor suggested by Judd. However, the simple method introduced can be seen as useful in the study of new laser crystals.},

Our results indicate that for the Gaussian distribution the phase transition is always second-order. For the bimodal distribution, there is indeed a tricritical point. However, its location is strongly dependent on c. The tricritical point is suppressed below a certain minimum value of connectivity.},

Below the distortion temperature (T D =6.13K) a large basal-plane contribution to the electric field gradient arises, due entirely to the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect, whilst the lattice contribution remains small.

  abstract  = {At around 14 K DyVO4 undergoes a crystallographic phase transition from tetragonal to a lower symmetry, very probably orthorhombic. It is proposed that the distortion arises from a Jahn Teller splitting of an accidently degenerate pair of low lying Dy3+ doublets. The distortion direction is correlated with the direction of principal g value and can be influenced by applied magnetic fields. In the orthorhombic phase DyVO4 orders antiferromagnetically with a Néel temperature of 3.0 K. The direction of moment alignment is the basal plane.
Résumé
Le vanadate de dysprosium subit vers 14 K une transformation de phase allant de las symmétrie tétragonale à une symmetrie inférieure, très probablement orthorhombique. On propose que cette distortion est cause par le dédoublement Jahn Teller d'un pair de doublets degeneres de basse energie du Dy3+. La direction de cette distortion est lieè a l'orientation du tenseur g et peut être influence par l'application d'un champs magnétiques. Dans sa phase orthorhombique le DyVO4 est ordonné d'une facon antiferromagnetique avec une temperature de Néel egale à 3 K. Les moments sont alignes dans le plan de base.},

A considerable softening of the Young modulus is observed for HoVO4 and YbVO4 at T < 70 K and T < 150 K, respectively; this effect is adequately described in the framework of the generalized susceptibility formalism. It is shown that the field dependences of the $\Delta$E-effect and their temperature variation in YbVO4 can also be described using this approach. To compare with experiment, the magnetoelastic contributions to the Young modulus of an isotropic polycrystal from various elastic modes have been averaged. For the Yb vanadate, considerable magnetoelastic anomalies in the thermal expansion along the tetragonal a and c axes have been discovered. The magnetoelastic contributions are used for determining completely symmetric magnetoelastic coefficients; the role of the completely symmetric quadrupole constant for magnetoelastic effects is analyzed.},

Polarized absorption and emission spectra as well as excited state luminescence lifetimes have been measured and analyzed especially at cryogenic temperatures in the 1.5–1.6 μm and 1.8–1.9 μm spectral ranges to assess laser qualities of these materials. The emission cross sections for 4I132→4I15/2 (Er) and 3F4→3H6 (Tm) transitions at T = 77 K were determined and confronted to the results obtained at room temperature. Effective emission cross sections estimated for aforementioned erbium and thulium transitions indicate that effective laser operation at cryogenic temperatures can be achieved in the gadolinium and lutetium vanadate crystals. Efficiency of laser material depends on its ability to heat distribution upon high-power energy pumping process. Accordingly, it has been found that the anisotropy of thermal conductivity for the undoped crystals is weakly influenced by the temperature albeit conductivity values for the GdVO4 are higher than those for LuVO4 at all temperatures. Incorporation of erbium or thulium ions results in a decrease of thermal conductivity in the two vanadate crystals and an anomalous temperature dependence of thermal conductivity in the LuVO4 was observed. Anisotropy of temperature dependence of thermal conductivity was found for the LuVO4:3.2 at%Tm3+ crystal. In this case the thermal conductivity along c-axis is inferior to that along a-axis of the crystal.},

In particular, it has been shown that, contrary to previous statements: the critical exponents for different probability distributions of the random fields and for diluted antiferromagnets in a field are the same. Therefore, critical universality, which is a perturbative renormalization-group prediction, holds beyond the validity regime of perturbation theory. Most notably, dimensional reduction is restored at five dimensions, i.e., the exponents of the random-field Ising model at five dimensions and those of the pure Ising ferromagnet at three dimensions are the same.},

  abstract  = {Crystal growth using the optical floating zone technique has been extensively used to grow a variety of bulk crystals, particularly single crystals of metal oxides. A comprehensive review of the literature has identified the most important experimental variables during image furnace crystal growth to be the nature of the feed rod, the growth rate, the growth atmosphere and gas pressure, the temperature gradient within the sample, the molten zone temperature and the rotation rate. The evidence from the literature further suggests that in order to prepare high quality crystals, these experimental variables typically need to be closely tailored to the characteristics of the material being grown. However, little attention appears to have been given to investigating in detail the effects that varying these experimental parameters can have upon crystal growths; for example, few reports seek to explain in a scientific way why a specific combination of parameters has been chosen for a particular growth. This article attempts firstly to collate the available evidence describing experimental procedures used during image furnace crystal growth and then to relate it to both the actual zoning process and the eventual crystal quality. Since the vast majority of the reported work using image furnaces has involved oxides, this article inevitably reflects this bias, although other types of materials are also covered.},

  abstract  = {Precise measurements of the order parameter and the c axis electric susceptibility have been made near the Jahn-Teller phase transitions in DyAsO 4 and DyVO 4 . Both compounds show large departures from simple mean-field (MF) theory. The phase transition in DyAsO 4 is of first order while that of DyVO 4 is continuous. The data are analysed using a correlated-effective-field (CEF) model in which a simple approximation, consistent with classical critical behaviour, is made for the dependence on q of the effective exchange constant J(q). The CEF model gives an excellent description of the data over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields, both below and above T D . This agreement establishes that the competing effects of short- and long-range interactions are responsible for the deviations from MF behaviour; the model accounts for the first- and second-order nature of the phase transitions in these compounds. The large c axis dielectric anomalies imply the existence of appreciable electric dipole moments and are interpreted in terms of coupling to odd-symmetry q=0 modes. From the measurements they find that the odd-symmetry (electric dipolar) couplings are in order of magnitude larger in DyVO 4 than in DyAsO 4 . These interactions of relatively long range appear to be strong enough in DyVO 4 to ensure a continuous phase transition, but are too weak to do so in DyAsO 4 .},

It is found that there is a surprising variation of the compositional dependence of the transition temperatures TD(p) and TN(p), which cannot be adequately explained by conventional pseudo-spin molecular field and pair model approximations. A detailed formalism has been developed that accounts for the observations in terms of a magneto-strictively induced quadrupole moment on the Gd3+ ions in the mixed crsytal system and, concomitant quadrupole interactions between the Dy3+ and Gd3+ ions. The application of the formalism to the corresponding variation of TD(p) in the simple diluent system Dyp Y1-p VO4 (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) is also discussed.},

The introduction of Gd and Y dilutes the active components causing the phase change, resulting in a reduction of the transition temperature T D (p). Varying p varies the splitting of E g phonons below T p (p) and also the energy of low-lying collective electronic excitations. The Tb system shows unique behaviour with p=0.365; a transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry occurs at 8.5K but the crystal reverts to tetragonal symmetry below 2.3K. The effect in the Tb system can be explained by mean-field theory. The Dy compounds are explained using series expansion and modified mean-field methods.},

The authors have measured changes in linear birefringence ( Delta n) associated with the cooperative Jahn-Teller phase transition of DyVO 4 near 14K as a function of temperature and magnetic fields, B, between 0.024 and 0.095 T. Theoretical arguments show that Delta n is directly proportional to the order parameter of the transition and that B 2 is equivalent to the conjugate ordering field. By extrapolation to zero field they obtain the temperature dependence of the order parameter and the susceptibility. The data are compared with calculations based on a mean-field 'compressible' Ising model. For a reasonable choice of adjustable parameters this classical description gives a good fit to the data close to T D consistent with general theoretical arguments and more detailed calculations, but it deviates progressively away from T D presumably because of the known importance of short-range interactions in the system.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The energy of the four lowest crystal field levels of Tb3+ in the mixed crystals TbpY1−pAsO4 is investigated in the range of the crystallographic and magnetic phase transition as a function of temperature and Tb-concentration (0.2 < p ≦ 1). The results show that, in contrast to the magnetic ordering, the interaction causing the crystallographic transition is of long range and hence a simple molecular field theory fits the experimental data. For small Tb-concentrations, the feature of this system are superimposed by effects of internal strains caused by the substitution of Tb3+ by Y3+ ions.},

  abstract  = {A wide range of strongly correlated quantum materials, including some high-temperature superconductors, exhibit {\textquotedblleft}electronic nematic{\textquotedblright} phases, in which the electronic properties spontaneously break the rotational symmetry of the crystal. However, the role that the corresponding nematic fluctuations play in these complicated systems is unclear, motivating the search for simpler model systems. Here, we identify a particular 4f intermetallic material which exhibits ferroquadrupole order, YbRu2Ge2, as just such a model system. We also provide a robust and accurate method to probe the divergence of an important associated quantity, the quadrupole-strain susceptibility. The temperature dependence of this quantity provides insight into the nature of the interactions that lead to ferroquadrupole order, in this case, magnetoelastic coupling.Ferroquadrupole order associated with local 4f atomic orbitals of rare-earth ions is a realization of electronic nematic order. However, there are relatively few examples of intermetallic materials which exhibit continuous ferroquadrupole phase transitions, motivating the search for additional materials that fall into this category. Furthermore, it is not clear a priori whether experimental approaches based on transport measurements which have been successfully used to probe the nematic susceptibility in materials such as the Fe-based superconductors will be as effective in the case of 4f intermetallic materials, for which the important electronic degrees of freedom are local rather than itinerant and are consequently less strongly coupled to the charge-carrying quasiparticles near the Fermi energy. In the present work, we demonstrate that the intermetallic compound YbRu2Ge2 exhibits a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition consistent with ferroquadrupole order of the Yb ions and go on to show that elastoresistivity measurements can indeed provide a clear window on the diverging nematic susceptibility in this system. This material provides an arena in which to study the causes and consequences of electronic nematicity.},

The study of multipolar interactions concerning the unfilled 4f shell has known a great development in rare earth (R) intermetallic compounds. It involves the complex problems of both the crystalline electric field (CEF) acting on a 4f ion and the pair interactions between different ions. The electron–lattice coupling can drive very characteristic magneto–elastic features—in particular, in elastic constants and in magnetostriction, through symmetry lowering modes depending on the 4f electronic states. The magneto–elastic modulation of the CEF corresponds to a gain of energy larger than the elastic energy lost at the thermodynamic equilibrium. The quantum Hamiltonian describes both the one- and two-ion, spin, and quadrupolar couplings in systems of cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal symmetries. The power of the susceptibility formalism, which allows independent determinations of the various coefficients, is discussed in this chapter. The main experimental evidence of quadrupolar orderings is presented along with the quadrupolar consequences on the magnetic properties. The experimental techniques which are based on the susceptibility formalism are illustrated.},
