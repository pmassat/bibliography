  Abstract                 = {We studied ab-plane transport properties in single crystals of the superconductor β -FeSe up to 16 T. In the normal state, below 90 K, the crystals present a strongly anisotropic positive magnetoresistance that becomes negligible above that temperature. In the superconducting state (T c =8.87(5) K) the upper critical field anisotropy H c 2 || ab / H c 2 || c changes with temperature and the angular dependence of the dissipation for fixed temperatures and fields reflects a strongly anisotropic behavior. Our results make evident that multiband effects are needed to describe the measured transport properties. We model the magnetoresistance and upper critical field behavior with a two-band model showing that the diffusivities ratio parameter remains unchanged going from the normal to the superconducting state.},

We introduce how to extract the coupling information through phonon lineshape.

A comparative study between Raman phonon theories and experiments allows us to gain insight into some crucial electronic properties, especially superconductivity. Finally, we summarize and compare EPC in the two existing HTSC systems, and discuss what role it may play in the HTSC.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of superconductivity in the iron-based materials requires an understanding of the phase diagram of the normal state. In these compounds, superconductivity emerges when stripe spin density wave (SDW) order is suppressed by doping, pressure or atomic disorder. This magnetic order is often pre-empted by nematic order, whose origin is yet to be resolved. One scenario is that nematic order is driven by orbital ordering of the iron 3d electrons that triggers stripe SDW order. Another is that magnetic interactions produce a spin-nematic phase, which then induces orbital order. Here we report the observation by neutron powder diffraction of an additional fourfold-symmetric phase in Ba1−xNaxFe2As2 close to the suppression of SDW order, which is consistent with the predictions of magnetically driven models of nematic order.},

  abstract =  {A fundamental and unconventional characteristic of superconductivity in iron-based materials is that it occurs in the vicinity of two other instabilities. In addition to a tendency towards magnetic order, these Fe-based systems have a propensity for nematic ordering: a lowering of the rotational symmetry while time-reversal invariance is preserved. Setting the stage for superconductivity, it is heavily debated whether the nematic symmetry breaking is driven by lattice, orbital or spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report a very clear splitting of NMR resonance lines in FeSe at Tnem = 91 K, far above the superconducting Tc of 9.3 K. The splitting occurs for magnetic fields perpendicular to the Fe planes and has the temperature dependence of a Landau-type order parameter. Spin–lattice relaxation rates are not affected at Tnem, which unequivocally establishes orbital degrees of freedom as driving the nematic order. We demonstrate that superconductivity competes with the emerging nematicity.},

The multi-orbital character and the strength of correlations underlie this complex phenomenology, involving magnetic softness and anisotropies, with Hund's coupling playing an important role. We review here the different theoretical approaches used to describe the magnetic interactions in these systems. We show that taking into account the orbital degree of freedom allows us to unify in a single phase diagram the main mechanisms proposed to explain the ( π , 0 ) order in iron pnictides: nesting-driven superconductivity, exchange between localised spins, and Hund-induced magnetic state with orbital differentiation. Comparison of theoretical estimates and experimental results helps locate the Fe superconductors in the phase diagram. In addition, orbital physics is crucial to address the magnetic softness, the doping-dependent properties, and the anisotropies.},

  Abstract                 = {Metallic, oxygen-deficient compounds in the Ba−La−Cu−O system, with the composition Ba x La5−xCu5O5(3−y) have been prepared in polycrystalline form. Samples withx=1 and 0.75,y>0, annealed below 900{\textdegree}C under reducing conditions, consist of three phases, one of them a perovskite-like mixed-valent copper compound. Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

  Abstract                 = {In FeSe1−x Te x , the superconducting and magnetic properties can be tuned not only by the Se-Te ratio x, but also by application of hydrostatic pressure. It was seen that both parent compounds FeSe and FeTe are extremely sensitive on hydrostatic pressure and show quite unexpected effects. The at ambient pressure superconducting FeSe exhibits at pressures above 1 GPa a phase, where superconductivity and antiferromagnetism seem to coexist on an atomic scale. The antiferromagnetic FeTe, on the other hand, transforms from a low pressure antiferromagnet to a ferromagnet above 2 GPa. These pressure studies underline the close relation of the electronic phases to the crystallographic properties, since in these simple compounds already minor changes in the structure for example by application of pressure lead to a drastic change of the superconducting and magnetic properties.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a muon spin rotation (μSR) study of the magnetic and superconducting properties of single crystals of electron-doped BaFe 2− x Co x As 2 with x = 0.08, 0.20 and 0.25 ( T c = 9, 25 and 20 K) and of polycrystalline hole-doped Pr 1− x Sr x FeAsO with x = 0 and 0.2 ( T c = 15 K). In the former series, we observe some interesting parallels with the electron-doped SmFeAsO 1− x F x 1111-type system (Drew et al 2009 Nat. Mater. 8 310). In particular, we obtain evidence that strongly disordered static magnetism coexists with superconductivity on a microscopic scale in underdoped samples and even at optimum doping there is a slowing down (or enhancement) of dynamic magnetic correlations below T c ≈25 K. In contrast, for the hole-doped Pr 1− x Sr x FeAsO samples we obtain evidence for a mesoscopic phase segregation into regions with nearly unperturbed antiferromagnetic (AF) order and others that are non-magnetic and most likely superconducting. The observed trend resembles the one that was previously reported for hole-doped Ba 1− x K x Fe 2 As 2 (Aczel et al 2008 Phys. Rev. B 78 214503, Park et al 2009 Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 117006) and thus might be a common property of the hole-doped systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Unconventional superconductivity usually originates from several strongly coupled degrees of freedom, such as magnetic, charge and elastic. A highly anisotropic electronic phase, not driven by lattice degrees of freedom, has been proposed in some of these superconductors, from cuprates to iron-based compounds. In the iron pnictide BaFe2As2, this nematic phase arises in the paramagnetic phase and is present for wide doping and temperature ranges. Here we probe the in-plane electronic anisotropy of electron- and hole-doped BaFe2As2 compounds. Unlike other materials, the resistivity anisotropy behaves very differently for electron- and hole-type dopants and even changes sign on the hole-doped side. This behaviour is explained by Fermi surface reconstruction in the magnetic phase and spin-fluctuation scattering in the paramagnetic phase. This unique transport anisotropy unveils the primary role played by magnetic scattering, demonstrating the close connection between magnetism, nematicity and unconventional superconductivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed knowledge of the phase diagram and the nature of the competing magnetic and superconducting phases is imperative for a deeper understanding of the physics of iron-based superconductivity. Magnetism in the iron-based superconductors is usually a stripe-type spin-density-wave, which breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice, and is known to compete strongly with superconductivity. Recently, it was found that in some systems an additional spin-density-wave transition occurs, which restores this tetragonal symmetry, however, its interaction with superconductivity remains unclear. Here, using thermodynamic measurements on Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals, we show that the spin-density-wave phase of tetragonal symmetry competes much stronger with superconductivity than the stripe-type spin-density-wave phase, which results in a novel re-entrance of the latter at or slightly below the superconducting transition.},

The nematic susceptibility is extracted from shear-modulus data (obtained using a three-point-bending method in a capacitance dilatometer) using Landau theory and is compared to the nematic susceptibility obtained from elastoresistivity and Raman data. FeSe is particularly interesting in this context, because of a large nematic, i.e., a structurally distorted but paramagnetic, region in its phase diagram. Scaling of the nematic susceptibility with the spin lattice relaxation rate from NMR, as predicted by the spin-nematic theory, is found in both electron- and hole-doped BaFe2As2, but not in FeSe. The intricate relationship of the nematic susceptibility to spin and orbital degrees of freedom is discussed.},

  abstract =  {Iron-based superconductors are well known for their complex interplay between structure, magnetism and superconductivity. FeSe offers a particularly fascinating example. This material has been intensely discussed because of its extended nematic phase, whose relationship with magnetism is not obvious. Superconductivity in FeSe is highly tunable, with the superconducting transition temperature, T c , ranging from 8â€‰K in bulk single crystals at ambient pressure to almost 40â€‰K under pressure or in intercalated systems, and to even higher temperatures in thin films. In this topical review, we present an overview of nematicity, magnetism and superconductivity, and discuss the interplay of these phases in FeSe. We focus on bulk FeSe and the effects of physical pressure and chemical substitutions as tuning parameters. The experimental results are discussed in the context of the well-studied iron-pnictide superconductors and interpretations from theoretical approaches are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the dependence of the electronic structure of iron pnictides on the angle formed by the arsenic–iron bonds. Within a Slater–Koster tight binding model which captures the correct symmetry properties of the bands, we show that the density of states and the band structure are sensitive to the distortion of the tetrahedral environment of the iron atoms. This sensitivity is extremely strong in a two-orbital (d xz , d yz ) model due to the formation of a flat band around the Fermi level. Inclusion of the d xy orbital destroys the flat band while keeping considerable angle dependence in the band structure.},

  abstract  = {We review the \{BCS\} to Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover scenario which is based on the well known crossover generalization of the \{BCS\} ground state wavefunction Ψ 0 . While this ground state has been summarized extensively in the literature, this Review is devoted to less widely discussed issues: understanding the effects of finite temperature, primarily below T c , in a manner consistent with Ψ 0 . Our emphasis is on the intersection of two important problems: high T c superconductivity and superfluidity in ultracold fermionic atomic gases. We address the “pseudogap state” in the copper oxide superconductors from the vantage point of a BCS–BEC crossover scenario, although there is no consensus on the applicability of this scheme to high T c . We argue that it also provides a useful basis for studying atomic gases near the unitary scattering regime; they are most likely in the counterpart pseudogap phase. That is, superconductivity takes place out of a non-Fermi liquid state where preformed, metastable fermion pairs are present at the onset of their Bose condensation. As a microscopic basis for this work, we summarize a variety of T-matrix approaches, and assess their theoretical consistency. A close connection with conventional superconducting fluctuation theories is emphasized and exploited.},

Usually ruby chips cut from bulk crystals are used which are ill-characterized and inconvenient to handle and to identify visually. Here we present a systematic study on corundum samples doped with Cr3+ ions with concentration from 60 to 23500 ppm to determine the optimal conditions for the use as an accurate pressure marker. The influence of the excitation wavelength on the luminescence spectra was investigated. These studies led to the synthesis of small (1–50 micrometer) ruby spheres with 3000 ppm chromium concentration. After annealing and a heat treatment to avoid internal strains we find reproducible values of the position and the width of the fluorescence lines. These ruby spheres are not only well suited for a reliable and accurate pressure determination in experiments using diamond anvil cells, but can also be used as an in sihr micro-thermometer in high pressure-low temperature studies.},

  abstract  = {The mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in iron-based superconductors (IBSs) is one of the most intriguing questions in current materials research. Among non-oxide IBSs, (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2 has been intensively studied because of its high superconducting transition temperature and fascinating evolution of the superconducting gap structure from being fully isotropic at optimal doping (x ≈ 0.4) to becoming nodal at x \&gt; 0.8. Although this marked evolution was identified in several independent experiments, there are no details of the gap evolution to date because of the lack of high-quality single crystals covering the entire K-doping range of the superconducting dome. We conducted a systematic study of the London penetration depth, λ(T), across the full phase diagram for different concentrations of point-like defects introduced by 2.5-MeV electron irradiation. Fitting the low-temperature variation with the power law, Δλ ~ Tn, we find that the exponent n is the highest and the Tc suppression rate with disorder is the smallest at optimal doping, and they evolve with doping being away from optimal, which is consistent with increasing gap anisotropy, including an abrupt change around x ≃ 0.8, indicating the onset of nodal behavior. Our analysis using a self-consistent t-matrix approach suggests the ubiquitous and robust nature of s{\textpm} pairing in IBSs and argues against a previously suggested transition to a d-wave state near x = 1 in this system.},

The upper critical field parallel to the ab-plane, Hc2ab, is above 77 T while that along the c-axis direction, Hc2c, is just above 36 T, yielding a low superconducting anisotropy ratio âˆ¼2. The estimated inter-plane coherence length based on the Ginzburgâ€“Landau (G-L) theory indicates BaFe2(As0.68P0.32)2 is still above the point for a dimensional crossover inferring the superconducting layers are not weakly-coupled in this system.

The calculated structural parameters show a good agreement with the experimental and other theoretical results. The optimized lattice parameters, independent elastic constants (C11, C12, C13, C33, C44, and C66), bulk modulus B, compressibility K, shear modulus G, and Poissonâ€™s ratio Î½, as well as the band structures, total and atom projected densities of states, and finally the optical properties of FeSe have been evaluated and discussed. The band structure and density of states show that this phase has metallic behavior and the major contribution comes from Fe-3d states. Further, the first time investigated optical functions reveal that the reflectivity is high in the IR-UV region up to 19.5Â eV, showing this to be promising coating material.},

  Abstract                 = {High-temperature superconductivity often emerges in the proximity of a symmetry-breaking ground state. For superconducting iron arsenides, in addition to the antiferromagnetic ground state, a small structural distortion breaks the crystal’s C4 rotational symmetry in the underdoped part of the phase diagram. We reveal that the representative iron arsenide Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 develops a large electronic anisotropy at this transition via measurements of the in-plane resistivity of detwinned single crystals, with the resistivity along the shorter b axis ρb being greater than ρa. The anisotropy reaches a maximum value of ~2 for compositions in the neighborhood of the beginning of the superconducting dome. For temperatures well above the structural transition, uniaxial stress induces a resistivity anisotropy, indicating a substantial nematic susceptibility.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the Landau paradigm of continuous phase transitions, ordered states of matter are characterized by a broken symmetry. Although the broken symmetry is usually evident, determining the driving force behind the phase transition can be complicated by coupling between distinct order parameters. We show how measurement of the divergent nematic susceptibility of the iron pnictide superconductor Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 distinguishes an electronic nematic phase transition from a simple ferroelastic distortion. These measurements also indicate an electronic nematic quantum phase transition near the composition with optimal superconducting transition temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {e theory of the Raman scattering by crystals is discussed and detailed calculations made of the spectra from sodium iodide and potassium bromide. Expressions for the dependence of the optical polarizability on the normal modes of vibration are obtained by using the shell model with anharmonic interactions between the electronic dipole moments. The absolute intensity of the spectra can then be obtained from the parameters of these models. The effects of the anharmonic interactions between the normal modes on the spectra are also discussed, particularly for the one-phonon spectra. Detailed calculations of the two-phonon spectra of sodium iodide and potassium bromide at several temperatures have been made. The intensities and shapes of the spectra are strongly dependent on the polarizations of the incident and scattered light and on the orientation of the crystal. The dependence on the orientation makes a direct comparison with the available experimental measurements impossible, but the frequencies of the experimentally observed peaks can be correlated with peaks in the calculated curves quite satisfactorily.},

  Abstract                 = {Point-contact spectroscopy was originally developed for the determination of the electron–phonon spectral function in normal metals. However, in the past 20 years it has become an important tool in the investigation of superconductors. As a matter of fact, point contacts between a normal metal and a superconductor can provide information on the amplitude and symmetry of the energy gap that, in the superconducting state, opens up at the Fermi level. In this paper we review the experimental and theoretical aspects of point-contact spectroscopy in superconductors, and we give an experimental survey of the most recent applications of this technique to anisotropic and multiband superconductors.},

  Abstract                 = {The Coulomb repulsion, impeding electrons' motion, has an important impact on the charge dynamics. It mainly causes a reduction in the effective metallic Drude weight (proportional to the so-called optical kinetic energy), encountered in the optical conductivity, with respect to the expectation within the nearly free electron limit (defining the so-called band kinetic energy), as evinced from band-structure calculations. In principle, the ratio between the optical and band kinetic energies allows one to define the degree of electronic correlations. Through spectral weight arguments on the excitation spectrum, we provide an experimental tool, free from any theoretical- or band-structure-based assumptions, to estimate the degree of electronic correlations in several systems. We first address the novel iron-pnictide superconductors, which serve to set the stage for our approach. We then revisit a large variety of materials, ranging from superconductors, to Kondo-like systems as well as materials close to the Mott-insulating state. For comparison, we also tackle materials where the electron–phonon coupling dominates. We establish a direct relationship between the strength of interaction and the resulting reduction in optical kinetic energy of the itinerant charge carriers.},

  abstract  = {The intermediate valence systems TmSe and SmB 6 have been investigated up to 16 and 18 GPa by ac microcalorimetry with a pressure ( p ) tuning realized in situ at low temperature. For TmSe, the transition from an antiferromagnetic insulator for p <3 GPa to an antiferromagnetic metal at higher pressure has been confirmed. A drastic change in the p variation of the Néel temperature ( T N ) is observed at 3 GPa. In the metallic phase ( p >3 GPa), T N is found to increase linearly with p . A similar linear p increase of T N is observed for the quasitrivalent compound TmS, which is at ambient pressure equivalent to TmSe at p ~7 GPa. In the case of SmB 6 long range magnetism has been detected above p ~8 GPa, i.e. at a pressure slightly higher than the pressure of the insulator to metal transition. However a homogeneous magnetic phase occurs only above 10 GPa. The magnetic and electronic properties are related to the renormalization of the 4f wavefunction either to the divalent or the trivalent configurations. As observed in SmS, long range magnetism in SmB 6 occurs already far below the pressure where a trivalent Sm 3+ state will be reached. It seems possible to describe roughly the physical properties of the intermediate valence equilibrium by assuming formulae for the Kondo lattice temperature depending on the valence configuration. Comparison is also made with the appearance of long range magnetism in cerium and ytterbium heavy fermion compounds.},

Four different crystal orientations of the β(Fe1−xSe) phase formed from one δ(Fe1−xSe) grain were detected by polarised light microscopy. This behaviour is typical for diffusion-less transformations. The diffusion-less character of δ(Fe1−xSe) to β(Fe1−xSe) transformation was confirmed by thermal analysis.},

We have observed two superconducting gaps with different values: a large gap (Δ~12 meV) on the two small hole-like and electron-like Fermi surface (FS) sheets, and a small gap (~6 meV) on the large hole-like FS. Both gaps, closing simultaneously at the bulk transition temperature ( T c ), are nodeless and nearly isotropic around their respective FS sheets. The isotropic pairing interactions are strongly orbital dependent, as the ratio 2Δ/ k B T c switches from weak to strong coupling on different bands. The same and surprisingly large superconducting gap due to strong pairing on the two small FSs, which are connected by the (π, 0) spin-density-wave vector in the parent compound, strongly suggests that the pairing mechanism originates from the inter-band interactions between these two nested FS sheets.},

  Abstract                 = {(Ba,K)Fe2As2 superconducting wires have been fabricated by ex-situ powder-in-tube method. In addition to the pure (Ba,K)Fe2As2 wires, silver powder was also used as a chemical addition to improve the performance of these superconducting wires. The transport critical current density (Jc) has reached 1.3×104 A/cm2 at 4.2K under self field in the wire with Ag addition. The self-field Jc is the highest among all the reported Fe-based superconducting wires so far. We have also performed magneto-optical imaging to this (Ba,K)Fe2As2 superconducting wire with Ag addition, and intragranular Jc of 6.0×104 A/cm2 at 20K is obtained, which is similar to the estimation from M-H measurement.},

The observed renormalization points to moderate many-body effects beyond the \{DFT\} like in ordinary transition metals. From large empirical background dielectric constants ε ∞ = 12 - 13 , we estimate a large As or P polarizability which significantly reduces the Hubbard U d ≈ 4 eV as suggested by bad metal scenarios to below 2 eV pointing to rather strong polaronic effects as suggested by G. Sawatzky et al. Europhys. Lett. 86 (2009) 17006. From the μ \{SR\} penetration depth at T = 0 and the Ω p from optics, we estimate the total el–boson coupling constant λ tot ≈ 0.6 ± 0.25 for LaFeAsO0.9F0.1 using Eliashberg-theory and arrive at the quasi-clean limit.},

Our findings also allow us to estimate the dichroism, which extends to high frequencies and temperatures. These results reveal a nematic susceptibility as well as the electronic nature of the structural transition.},

For temperatures below the Neel transition, the topology of the reconstructed Fermi surface, combined with the distinct behavior of the scattering rates, determines the anisotropy of the low-frequency optical response. For the itinerant charge carriers, we are able to disentangle the evolution of the Drude weights and scattering rates and to observe their enhancement along the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic a -axis with respect to the ferromagnetic b -axis. For temperatures above the structural phase transition, uniaxial stress induces a finite in-plane anisotropy. The anisotropy of the optical conductivity, leading to significant dichroism, extends to high frequencies in the mid- and near-infrared regions. The temperature dependence of the dichroism at all dopings scales with the anisotropy ratio of dc conductivity, suggesting the electronic nature of the structural transition. Our findings bear testimony to a large nematic susceptibility that couples very effectively to the uniaxial lattice strain. In order to clarify the subtle interplay of magnetism and Fermi surface topology we compare our results with theoretical calculations obtained from density functional theory within the full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate how emergent nematic order and nematic fluctuations affect several macroscopic properties of both the normal and superconducting states of the iron pnictides. Due to its magnetic origin, long-range nematic order enhances magnetic fluctuations, leaving distinctive signatures in the spin–lattice relaxation rate, the spin–spin correlation function, and the uniform magnetic susceptibility. This enhancement of magnetic excitations is also manifested in the electronic spectral function, where a pseudogap can open at the hot spots of the Fermi surface. In the nematic phase, electrons are scattered by magnetic fluctuations that are anisotropic in momentum space, giving rise to a non-zero resistivity anisotropy whose sign changes between electron-doped and hole-doped compounds. We also show that due to the magneto-elastic coupling, nematic fluctuations soften the shear modulus in the normal state, but harden it in the superconducting state. The latter effect is an indirect consequence of the competition between magnetism and superconductivity, and also causes a suppression of the orthorhombic distortion below T c . We also demonstrate that ferro-orbital fluctuations enhance the nematic susceptibility, cooperatively promoting an electronic tetragonal symmetry-breaking. Finally, we argue that T c in the iron pnictides might be enhanced due to nematic fluctuations of magnetic origin.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability [mdash] in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the /`chicken and egg problem[rsquor]. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for nematicity and link them to the properties of the magnetic and superconducting states, providing a unified perspective on the phase diagram of the iron pnictides.},

  Abstract                 = {The acoustic-electric transformation in high-quality FeSe single crystals is studied. In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth.},

Significantly, the Néel transition is either preceded or accompanied by a structural transition that breaks the four-fold symmetry of the high-temperature lattice. Borrowing language from the field of soft condensed matter physics, this broken discrete rotational symmetry is widely referred to as an Ising nematic phase transition. Understanding the origin of this effect is a key component of a complete theoretical description of the occurrence of superconductivity in this family of compounds, motivating both theoretical and experimental investigation of the nematic transition and the associated in-plane anisotropy. Here we review recent experimental progress in determining the intrinsic in-plane electronic anisotropy as revealed by resistivity, reflectivity and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of detwinned single crystals of underdoped Fe-arsenide superconductors in the '122' family of compounds.},

  abstract  = {Correlated electron fluids can exhibit a startling array of complex phases, among which one of the more surprising is the electron nematic, a translationally invariant metallic phase with a spontaneously generated spatial anisotropy. Classical nematics generally occur in liquids of rod-like molecules; given that electrons are point like, the initial theoretical motivation for contemplating electron nematics came from thinking of the electron fluid as a quantum melted electron crystal, rather than a strongly interacting descendent of a Fermi gas. Dramatic transport experiments in ultra-clean quantum Hall systems in 1999 and in Sr3Ru2O7 in a strong magnetic field in 2007 established that such phases exist in nature. In this article, we briefly review the theoretical considerations governing nematic order, summarize the quantum Hall and Sr3Ru2O7 experiments that unambiguously establish the existence of this phase, and survey some of the current evidence for such a phase in the cuprate and Fe-based high temperature superconductors.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We review the recent developments in electronic Raman scattering measurements of charge nematic fluctuations in iron-based superconductors. A simple theoretical framework of a d-wave Pomeranchuk transition is proposed in order to capture the salient features of the spectra. We discuss the available Raman data in the normal state of 122 iron-based systems, particularly Co-doped BaFe2As2, and we show that the low-energy quasi-elastic peak, the extracted nematic susceptibility and the scattering rates are consistent with an electronic-driven structural phase transition. In the superconducting state with a full gap, the quasi-elastic peak transforms into a finite-frequency nematic resonance, evidences for which are particularly strong in the electron-doped systems. A crucial feature of the analysis is the fact that the electronic Raman signal is unaffected by the acoustic phonons. This makes Raman spectroscopy a unique probe of electronic nematicity.},

  abstract  = {Strong electronic correlations are often associated with the proximity of a Mott-insulating state. In recent years however, it has become increasingly clear that the Hund’s rule coupling (intra-atomic exchange) is responsible for strong correlations in multiorbital metallic materials that are not close to a Mott insulator. Hund’s coupling has two effects: It influences the energetics of the Mott gap and strongly suppresses the coherence scale for the formation of a Fermi liquid. A global picture has emerged recently, which emphasizes the importance of the average occupancy of the shell as a control parameter. The most dramatic effects occur away from half-filling or single occupancy. We review the theoretical understanding and physical properties of these Hund’s metals, together with the relevance of this concept to transition-metal oxides (TMOs) of the 3d, and especially 4d, series (such as ruthenates), as well as to the iron-based superconductors (iron pnictides and chalcogenides).},

  abstract =  {In the past 10 years, iron-based superconductors have created more puzzles than they have helped resolve. Some of the most fundamental outstanding questions are how strong the interactions are and what the electron pairing mechanism is. Now two groups have made contributions toward resolving these questions in the intriguing compound iron selenide (FeSe) (see the Perspective by Lee). Gerber et al. used photoemission spectroscopy coupled with x-ray diffraction to find that FeSe has a very sizable electron-phonon interaction. Quasiparticle interference imaging helped Sprau et al. determine the shape of the superconducting gap and find that the electron pairing in FeSe is orbital-selective.Science, this issue p. 71, p. 75; see also p. 32The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a {\textquotedblleft}coherent lock-in{\textquotedblright} measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Direct quantitative correlations between the orbital order and orthorhombicity is achieved in a number of Fe-based superconductors of 122 family. The former (orbital order) is calculated from first principles simulations using experimentally determined doping and temperature dependent structural parameters while the latter (the orthorhombicity) is taken from already established experimental studies; when normalized, both the above quantities quantitatively corresponds to each other in terms of their doping as well as temperature variations. This proves that the structural transition in Fe-based materials is electronic in nature due to orbital ordering. An universal correlations among various structural parameters and electronic structure are also obtained. Most remarkable among them is the mapping of two Fe–Fe distances in the low temperature orthorhombic phase, with the band energies E d xz , E d yz of Fe at the high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The fractional co-ordinate zAs of As which essentially determines anion height is inversely (directly) proportional to Fe-As bond distances (with exceptions of K doped BaFe2As2) for hole (electron) doped materials as a function of doping. On the other hand, Fe-As bond-distance is found to be inversely (directly) proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level for hole (electron) doped systems. Implications of these results to current issues of Fe based superconductivity are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past few years iron chalcogenides have been intensively studied as part of the wider family of iron-based superconductors, with many intriguing results reported so far on intercalated and monolayer FeSe. Nevertheless, bulk FeSe itself remains an unusual case when compared with pnictogen-based iron superconductors, and may hold clues to understanding the more exotic derivatives of the FeSe system. The FeSe phase diagram is distinct from the pnictides: the orthorhombic distortion, which is likely to be of a /`spin-nematic/' nature in numerous pnictides, is not accompanied by magnetic order in FeSe, and the superconducting transition temperature Tc rises significantly with pressure before decreasing. Here we show that the magnetic interactions in FeSe, as opposed to most pnictides, demonstrate an unusual and unanticipated frustration, which suppresses magnetic (but not nematic) order, triggers ferro-orbital order in the nematic phase and can naturally explain the non-monotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature Tc(P).},

An anomalously broadened Raman band at 620 cm−1 is observed and assigned to the in-plane boron stretching E2g mode. It exhibits a large Grüneisen parameter indicating that the vibration is highly anharmonic. The pressure dependencies of the E2g mode and Tc reveal anomalies at 15–22 GPa (isotope dependent). The anharmonic character of the E2g phonon mode, its anomalous pressure dependence, and also that for Tc are interpreted as a result of a phonon-assisted Lifshitz electronic topological transition.},

In contrast to other unconventional superconductors, in the Fe-HTSs both d-wave and extended s-wave pairing symmetries are close in energy. Probing the proximity between these very different superconducting states and identifying experimental parameters that can tune them is of central interest. Here we report high-pressure muon spin rotation experiments on the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth in the optimally doped nodeless s-wave Fe-HTS Ba0.65Rb0.35Fe2As2. Upon pressure, a strong decrease of the penetration depth in the zero-temperature limit is observed, while the superconducting transition temperature remains nearly constant. More importantly, the low-temperature behaviour of the inverse-squared magnetic penetration depth, which is a direct measure of the superfluid density, changes qualitatively from an exponential saturation at zero pressure to a linear-in-temperature behaviour at higher pressures, indicating that hydrostatic pressure promotes the appearance of nodes in the superconducting gap.},

  abstract  = {High-temperature superconductivity in the Fe-based materials emerges when the antiferromagnetism of the parent compounds is suppressed by either doping or pressure. Closely connected to the antiferromagnetic state are entangled orbital, lattice, and nematic degrees of freedom, and one of the major goals in this field has been to determine the hierarchy of these interactions. Here we present the direct measurements and the calculations of the in-plane uniform magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of BaFe2As2, which help in determining the above hierarchy. The magnetization measurements are made possible by utilizing a simple method for applying a large symmetry-breaking strain, based on differential thermal expansion. In strong contrast to the large resistivity anisotropy above the antiferromagnetic transition at T                        N, the anisotropy of the in-plane magnetic susceptibility develops largely below T                        N. Our results imply that lattice and orbital degrees of freedom play a subdominant role in these materials.},

Unexpectedly, we found that lower crystallinity samples, which were grown at a higher T s of 1250 °C than the optimized T s = 1050 °C, exhibit higher J c along the ab plane under high magnetic fields than the optimized samples. The presence of horizontal defects that act as strong vortex pinning centers, such as stacking faults, are a possible origin of the high J c values in the poor crystallinity samples.},

We propose that this apparent nonuniversality can actually be understood by considering the predictions of spin fluctuation theory and accounting for the peculiar electronic structure of these systems, coupled with the likely 'sign-changing s-wave' (s ± ) symmetry. We review theoretical aspects, materials properties and experimental evidence relevant to this suggestion, and discuss which further measurements would be useful to settle these issues. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a multitude of standards, of which some, for aught we know, may fail in any given case; and what is more satisfactory than any alternative in sight, may to the end be a sum of pluses and minuses, concerning which we can only trust that by ulterior corrections and improvements a maximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be approached.                        William James, Meaning of Truth},

  abstract  = {Abstract I review theoretical ideas and implications of experiments for the gap structure and symmetry of the Fe-based superconductors. Unlike any other class of unconventional superconductors, one has in these systems the possibility to tune the interactions by small changes in pressure, doping or disorder. Thus, measurements of order parameter evolution with these parameters should enable a deeper understanding of the underlying interactions. I briefly review the “standard paradigm” for s-wave pairing in these systems, and then focus on developments in the past several years which have challenged this picture. I further discuss the reasons for the apparent close competition between pairing in s- and d-wave channels, particularly in those systems where one type of Fermi surface pocket – hole or electron – is missing. Observation of a transition between s- and d-wave symmetry, possibly via a time reversal symmetry breaking “s + id” state, would provide an important confirmation of these ideas. Several proposals for detecting these novel phases are discussed, including the appearance of order parameter collective modes in Raman and optical conductivities. Transitions between two different types of s-wave states, involving various combinations of signs on Fermi surface pockets, can also proceed through a T -breaking “s + is” state. I discuss recent work that suggests pairing may take place away from the Fermi level over a surprisingly large energy range, as well as the effect of glide plane symmetry of the Fe-based systems on the superconductivity, including various exotic, time and translational invariance breaking pair states that have been proposed. Finally, I address disorder issues, and the various ways systematic introduction of disorder can (and cannot) be used to extract information on gap symmetry and structure.},

  Abstract                 = {In most unconventional superconductors, the importance of antiferromagnetic fluctuations is widely acknowledged. In addition, cuprate and iron-pnictide high-temperature superconductors often exhibit unidirectional (nematic) electronic correlations, including stripe and orbital orders, whose fluctuations may also play a key role for electron pairing. In these materials, however, such nematic correlations are intertwined with antiferromagnetic or charge orders, preventing the identification of the essential role of nematic fluctuations. This calls for new materials having only nematicity without competing or coexisting orders. Here we report systematic elastoresistance measurements in FeSe1−xSx superconductors, which, unlike other iron-based families, exhibit an electronic nematic order without accompanying antiferromagnetic order. We find that the nematic transition temperature decreases with sulfur content x; whereas, the nematic fluctuations are strongly enhanced. Near x≈0.17, the nematic susceptibility diverges toward absolute zero, revealing a nematic quantum critical point. The obtained phase diagram for the nematic and superconducting states highlights FeSe1−xSx as a unique nonmagnetic system suitable for studying the impact of nematicity on superconductivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent discovery of superconductivity with relatively high transition temperature (Tc) in the layered iron-based quaternary oxypnictides La[O1−xFx] FeAs by Kamihara et al. [Kamihara Y, Watanabe T, Hirano M, Hosono H (2008) Iron-based layered superconductor La[O1-xFx] FeAs (x = 0.05–0.12) with Tc = 26 K. J Am Chem Soc 130:3296–3297.] was a real surprise and has generated tremendous interest. Although superconductivity exists in alloy that contains the element Fe, LaOMPn (with M = Fe, Ni; and Pn = P and As) is the first system where Fe plays the key role to the occurrence of superconductivity. LaOMPn has a layered crystal structure with an Fe-based plane. It is quite natural to search whether there exists other Fe based planar compounds that exhibit superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity with zero-resistance transition temperature at 8 K in the PbO-type α-FeSe compound. A key observation is that the clean superconducting phase exists only in those samples prepared with intentional Se deficiency. FeSe, compared with LaOFeAs, is less toxic and much easier to handle. What is truly striking is that this compound has the same, perhaps simpler, planar crystal sublattice as the layered oxypnictides. Therefore, this result provides an opportunity to better understand the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in this class of unconventional superconductors.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the assumption that the superconducting state belongs to a single irreducible representation of lattice symmetry, we propose that the pairing symmetry in all measured iron-based superconductors is generally consistent with the A 1g s-wave. Robust s-wave pairing throughout the different families of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two fundamental principles behind high-T c superconducting mechanisms: (i) the correspondence principle: the short-range magnetic-exchange interactions and the Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high-T c superconductivity and determine pairing symmetries; (ii) the magnetic-selection pairing rule: superconductivity is only induced by the magnetic-exchange couplings from the super-exchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bonding. These principles explain why unconventional high-T c superconductivity appears to be such a rare but robust phenomena, with its strict requirements regarding the electronic environment. The results will help us to identify new electronic structures that can support high-T c superconductivity.},

  abstract  = {Epitaxial engineering of solid state heterointerfaces is a leading avenue to realizing enhanced or novel electronic states of matter. As a recent example, bulk FeSe is an unconventional superconductor with a modest transition temperature (Tc) of 9 K. However, when a single atomic layer of FeSe is grown on SrTiO3, its Tc can skyrocket by an order of magnitude to 65 K or 109 K. Since this discovery in 2012, efforts to reproduce, understand, and extend these findings continue to draw both excitement and scrutiny. In this review, we first present a critical survey of experimental measurements performed using a wide range of techniques. We then turn to the open question of microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity. We examine contrasting indications for both phononic (conventional) and magnetic/orbital (unconventional) means of electron pairing, as well as speculations about whether they could work cooperatively to boost Tc in a monolayer of FeSe. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics Volume 8 is March 10, 2017.

For all the doping levels, quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations were observed as a broad peak localized at Q = ( 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 , l ) . At lower energies, the peak shows an apparent anisotropy in the h k 0 plane; longitudinal peak widths are considerably smaller than transverse widths. The anisotropy is larger for the higher doping level. These results are consistent with the random phase approximation (RPA) calculations taking account of the orbital character of the electronic bands, confirming that the anisotropic nature of the spin fluctuations in the normal states is mostly dominated by the nesting of Fermi surfaces. On the other hand, the quasi-two-dimensional spin correlations grow much rapidly for decreasing temperature in the x = 0 parent compound, compared to that expected for nearly antiferromagnetic metals. This may be another sign of the unconventional nature of the antiferromagnetic transition in BaFe2As2.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper seeks to investigate effect of Mn doping in superconducting FeSe. It is found that over the entire doping range in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2053-1591/3/12/126001/mrxaa4c73ieqn3.gif] {${\mathrm{Fe}}_{1-x}$} Mn x Se ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2053-1591/3/12/126001/mrxaa4c73ieqn4.gif] {$0\leqslant x\leqslant 1$} ), Mn does not substitute Fe in the superconducting tetragonal phase. Instead two impurity phases, NiAs type hexagonal phase and NaCl type cubic phase, grow with increasing Mn content. Initially, hexagonal phase has a higher content than the cubic phase but beyond x = 0.5, the cubic phase grows rapidly and for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2053-1591/3/12/126001/mrxaa4c73ieqn5.gif] {$x\geqslant 0.8$} , the sample is monophasic with cubic NaCl type structure. The superconducting tetragonal phase content steadily decreases with increasing Mn concentration and completely disappears beyond x = 0.5. The premise that Mn never replaces Fe in the superconducting phase is further strengthened by observation of a sharp drop in AC susceptibility akin to superconducting transition at the T c of FeSe up to x  = 0.5. EXAFS studies at the Fe K edge also show that the Fe has a four coordinated tetragonal local structure in all compositions below x = 0.5, similar to that in FeSe and it gradually changes to a six coordinated one as is expected for a NaCl type cubic phase for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2053-1591/3/12/126001/mrxaa4c73ieqn6.gif] {$x\geqslant 0.5$} .},

It mainly focuses on the most contemporary developments in this field, pertaining to the observations of magnetic resonant modes in new superconductors, spin anisotropy of low-energy magnetic fluctuations that has now been observed in a wide range of chemical compositions and doping levels, as well as their momentum-space anisotropy incurred by the spin-nematic order. The implications of these new findings for our understanding of the superconducting state, along with the remaining unsettled challenges for neutron spectroscopy, are discussed.},

The spectra do not contain magnetic components and they exhibit quasi-continuous distribution of quadrupole split doublets. A distribution follows the electric field gradient (EFG) spatial modulation (wave) – EFGW. The \{EFGW\} is accompanied by some charge density wave (CDW) having about an order of magnitude lesser influence on the spectrum. The \{EFGW\} could be modeled as widely separated narrow sheets with the \{EFG\} increasing from small till maximum value almost linearly and subsequently dropping back to the original value in a similar fashion – across the sheet. One encounters very small and almost constant \{EFG\} between sheets. The \{EFGW\} shape and amplitude as well as the amplitude of \{CDW\} are strongly affected by a superconducting transition. All modulations are damped significantly at transition (38 K) and recover at a temperature being about 14 K lower. The maximum quadrupole splitting at 4.2 K amounts to about 2.1 mm/s, while the dispersion of \{CDW\} seen on the iron nuclei could be estimated far away from the superconducting gap opening and at low temperature as 0.5 el./a.u.3. It drops to about 0.3 el./a.u.3 just below transition to the superconducting state.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of the periodic potential and the residual Coulomb interaction on the inelastic scattering of light from pure electronic excitations in solids has been investigated by using the diagrammatic perturbation theory. It is shown that for a degenerate electron gas single-particle excitations with no spin reversals are heavily screened and almost all the scattering is from the collective plasma mode for momentum transfers small compared to Fermi-Thomas momentum. However, there is no screening of single-particle spin-density fluctuations. This is an important intra-band process for III--V semiconductors with an appreciable spin-orbit splitting of the valence band. For high concentration of carriers, the nonparabolicity of the band structure also contributes to the intra-band single-particle scattering. For low concentrations or at high temperatures, when plasma mode is no longer a well-defined normal mode of the system, these two processes are not important. In this case there is no screening of the single-particle excitations from electrons in a spherical parabolic band. For inter-band excitations, the effect of Coulomb interaction is shown to be negligible in the long-wavelength limit.},

  abstract  = {The response of the worldwide scientific community to the discovery in 2008 of superconductivity at T c = 26 K in the Fe-based compound LaFeAsO1−x F x has been very enthusiastic. In short order, other Fe-based superconductors with the same or related crystal structures were discovered with T c up to 56 K. Many experiments were carried out and theories formulated to try to understand the basic properties of these new materials and the mechanism for T c. In this selective critical review of the experimental literature, we distill some of this extensive body of work, and discuss relationships between different types of experiments on these materials with reference to theoretical concepts and models. The experimental normal-state properties are emphasized, and within these the electronic and magnetic properties because of the likelihood of an electronic/magnetic mechanism for superconductivity in these materials.},

The two phases thus coexist homogeneously at the microscopic scale. In Ba 0.6 K 0.4 Fe 2 As 2 , on the other hand, the signal loss below T onset SDW ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 75 K is not complete, revealing that magnetic order is bound to finite-size areas of the sample, while the remaining NMR signal shows a clear superconducting response below T c =37 K. Thus, the two phases are not homogeneously mixed, at least for this potassium concentration. For both samples, spatial electronic and/or magnetic inhomogeneity is shown to characterize the NMR properties in the normal state.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the pressure dependence of the upper critical fields ( μ 0 H c2 ) for FeSe single crystals with pressure up to 2.57 GPa. The superconducting (SC) properties show a disparate behavior across a critical pressure where the pressure-induced antiferromagnetic phase coexists with superconductivity. The magnetoresistance for H // ab and H // c is very different: for H // c , magnetic field induces and enhances a hump in the resistivity close to the T c for pressures higher than 1.2 GPa, while it is absent for H // ab . Since the measured μ 0 H c2 for FeSe samples is smaller than the orbital limited upper critical field ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-2048/29/3/035007/sustaa1185ieqn1.gif] {$({{{H}}^{{\rm{orb}}}}_{{\rm{c}}2})$} estimated by the Werthamer, Helfand and Hohenberg model, the Maki parameter ( α ) related to Pauli spin-paramagnetic effects is additionally considered to describe the temperature dependence of μ 0 H c2 ( T ). Interestingly, the α value is hardly affected by pressure for H // ab , while it strongly increases with pressure for H // c . The pressure evolution of the μ 0 H c2 (0) for the FeSe single crystals is found to be almost similar to that of T c ( P ), suggesting that the pressure-induced magnetic order adversely affects the upper critical fields as well as the SC transition temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the growth of high quality FeSe single crystals using chemical vapor transport based on an AlCl 3 /KCl eutectic and their physical properties were fully characterized by magnetic, transport and specific heat measurements. Their critical superconducting temperature at T c ∼ 8.7 K (width < 0.7 K) and structural tetragonal–orthorhombic transition at T s ∼ 85–90 K confirm the values already reported in the literature for similar crystals. In addition, the non-variation of T s under high magnetic field (up to 14 T) determined by magnetic and specific heat measurements indicates that spin fluctuations are not directly involved in the structural transition. Finally, high temperature electrical resistivity measurements up to 600 K evidence a maximum around 350 K. The origin of this crossover from metallic behavior at low temperature to a semiconducting-like regime at high temperature is discussed and could be associated with a change of carrier density above 350 K. On the other hand, the tentative growth of Te-substituted Fe(Se 1− x Te x ) crystals using the same growth method resulted in crystals with x (Te) < 1% and a slightly lower T c compared to pure FeSe ones, which may be related to transition metal–chalcogen non-stoichiometry. Finally, Cr doping at the Fe site was also attempted. In contrast to previous reports in the literature, our results suggest that Cr does not substitute for Fe in the FeSe crystal but agglomerates in Cr-rich (Cr,Fe)Se 2 inclusions, and T c of these (Fe 1− x Cr x )Se crystals is not increased, but slightly decreased in comparison to stoichiometric FeSe crystals.},

  Abstract                 = {Fermi systems in the cross-over regime between weakly coupled Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) and strongly coupled Bose–Einstein-condensate (BEC) limits are among the most fascinating objects to study the behavior of an assembly of strongly interacting particles. The physics of this cross-over has been of considerable interest both in the fields of condensed matter and ultracold atoms. One of the most challenging issues in this regime is the effect of large spin imbalance on a Fermi system under magnetic fields. Although several exotic physical properties have been predicted theoretically, the experimental realization of such an unusual superconducting state has not been achieved so far. Here we show that pure single crystals of superconducting FeSe offer the possibility to enter the previously unexplored realm where the three energies, Fermi energy εF, superconducting gap Δ, and Zeeman energy, become comparable. Through the superfluid response, transport, thermoelectric response, and spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that εF of FeSe is extremely small, with the ratio Δ/εF∼1(∼0.3) in the electron (hole) band. Moreover, thermal-conductivity measurements give evidence of a distinct phase line below the upper critical field, where the Zeeman energy becomes comparable to εF and Δ. The observation of this field-induced phase provides insights into previously poorly understood aspects of the highly spin-polarized Fermi liquid in the BCS-BEC cross-over regime.},

The substitution of natural Fe (containing ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 92% of 56 Fe) by its lighter 54 Fe isotope leads to a shift in T c of 0.22(5) K corresponding to an Fe-IE exponent of α Fe =0.81(15). Simultaneously, a small structural change with isotope substitution is observed by NPD, which may contribute to the total Fe isotope shift of T c .},

  abstract  = {The pressure–temperature phase diagrams of the heavy fermion antiferromagnet CeRhIn 5 and the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn 5 have been studied under hydrostatic pressure by ac calorimetry and ac susceptibility measurements using diamond anvil cells with argon as the pressure medium. In CeRhIn 5 , the use of a highly hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium allows for a clean simultaneous determination by a bulk probe of the antiferromagnetic and superconducting transitions. We compare our new phase diagram with the previous ones, discuss the nature (first or second order) of the various lines, and the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity. The link between the collapse of the superconducting heat anomaly and the broadening of the antiferromagnetic transition points to an inhomogeneous appearance of superconductivity below P c ≈ 1.95 GPa. Homogeneous bulk superconductivity is only observed above this critical pressure. We present a detailed analysis of the influence of pressure inhomogeneities on the specific heat anomalies which emphasizes that the observed broadening of the transitions near P c is connected with the first-order transition. For CeCoIn 5 we show that the large specific heat anomaly observed at T c at ambient pressure is suppressed linearly at least up to 3 GPa.},

The resonance peak observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments agrees well with predicted results for the extended s-wave (s {pm}) gap symmetry. Recent neutron scattering measurements show that there is a disparity between transverse and longitudinal components of the dynamical spin susceptibility. Such breaking of the spin-rotational invariance in the spin-liquid phase can occur due to spin-orbit coupling. We study the role of the spin-orbit interaction in the multiorbital model for Fe-pnictides and show how it affects the spin resonance feature.},

  Abstract                 = {Inelastic light scattering by the carriers interacting with phonons in the anisotropic metals with large penetration depth is theoretically studied. It is shown that the strong temperature dependence of the Raman scattering intensity in the region of phonon frequencies is the main characteristic feature of these processes. The effects of anisotropy, impurities and the strength of electron-phonon interaction on the frequency and temperature dependences of the polarization operator are analysed. Taking into account the anisotropy vertex corrections which obey a system of the Boltzman-type integral equations should leads to the considerable changes of the frequency behavior of scattering cross section for low frequencies. However, the changes of the temperature dependence are not so drastic. Increasing the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ affects the particle-hole polarization operator in two possible ways to weaken temperature dependence and to make flatter frequency curves. The same effects are also from impurities. Some theoretical consequences which concern the role of electron-phonon interaction for electron Raman scattering in high-Tc superconductors aboveTc are proposed.},

In these compounds, the interstitial Fe is known to strongly influence the magnetic and superconducting properties. Here, we present the chemical homogeneity range of ternary compounds Fe1 + y Te1−x Se x based on powder x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and magnetization measurements. Our investigations show that the maximum amount of excess Fe in homogeneous Fe1 + y Te1−x Se x decreases with increase in Se substitution for Te. Using our synthesis procedure, single-phase Fe1 + y Te1−x Se x , with 0.5 ≤ x < 1 could not be formed for any amount of excess Fe. Further, the superconducting volume fraction in the material is found to be strongly suppressed by excess Fe.},

A phonon mode near 100 cm−1 exhibits a sharp increase by ∼5% in the frequency below a temperature T s (∼100 K) attributed to strong spin–phonon coupling and onset of short-range antiferromagnetic order. In addition, two high frequency modes are observed at 1350 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1, attributed to electronic Raman scattering from ( x 2 – y 2 ) to x z / y z d-orbitals of Fe.},

Ambient nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) experiments were performed on FeSe to understand the partial phonon density of states (PDOS) of the high-pressure phases. On the basis of our experimental results and DFT calculations, we demonstrate a pressure-induced distortion of the low-temperature Cmma phase at around 1.6 GPa and the appearance of a high-pressure Pbnm phase. Upon increasing the pressure above 9 GPa, the orthorhombic phase becomes the major phase, and a mixed-phase region exists up to 26 GPa. The pressure-induced structural changes in this system and its connection to Tc enhancement are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The phase diagram of any given family of iron-based superconductors is complicated: Superconductivity competes with antiferromagnetism, with a structural transition often thrown in for good measure. Transport experiments have shown that in one of these families, Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2, a rotational electronic asymmetry, dubbed nematicity, drives the structural transition. Kuo et al. detected nematic fluctuations in five Fe-based superconductor families in the vicinity of optimal chemical doping: the doping that maximizes the superconducting transition temperature. Thus, nematicity may play a role in the mechanism of superconductivity in these compounds.Science, this issue p. 958A key actor in the conventional theory of superconductivity is the induced interaction between electrons mediated by the exchange of virtual collective fluctuations (phonons in the case of conventional s-wave superconductors). Other collective modes that can play the same role, especially spin fluctuations, have been widely discussed in the context of high-temperature and heavy Fermion superconductors. The strength of such collective fluctuations is measured by the associated susceptibility. Here we use differential elastoresistance measurements from five optimally doped iron-based superconductors to show that divergent nematic susceptibility appears to be a generic feature in the optimal doping regime of these materials. This observation motivates consideration of the effects of nematic fluctuations on the superconducting pairing interaction in this family of compounds and possibly beyond.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that in a clean two-band (transition-metal) superconductor there appears a collective excitation corresponding to small fluctuations of the relative phase of the two “condensates”. In contrast to the transverse collective excitations in ordinary superconductors, the energy of this mode can be derived directly from existing experimental data; for Nb it lies about at the middle of the smaller single-particle gap. Direct experimental detection of this resonance is estimated to be rather beyond the limits of available techniques, but its effect on the ultrasound dispersion curve should be easily observable. The phenomenon is used to elucidate the physical nature of excitons in superconductors in general.},

  Abstract                 = {Effect of non-hydrostatic stress on X-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) is studied. The pressure gradient in the sample chamber leads to the broadening of the diffraction peaks, which increase with the hkl index of the crystal. It is found that the difference between the determined d -spacing compressive ratio d / d 0 and the real d -spacing compressive ratio d r / d 0 is determined by the yield stress of the pressure transmitting media (if used) and the shear modulus of the sample. On the basis of the corrected experiment data of Mao et al. (MXB86), which was used to calibrate the most widely used ruby fluorescence scale, a new relationship of ruby fluorescence pressure scale is corrected, i.e., P = (1904/9.827)[(1 + Δλ/λ 0 ) 9.827 −1].},

  abstract  = {We report a pressure study on electron doped SrFe2−xCoxAs2 by electrical-resistivity (ρ) and magnetic-susceptibility (χ) experiments. Application of either external pressure or Co substitution rapidly suppresses the spin-density wave ordering of the Fe moments and induces superconductivity in SrFe2As2. At x=0.2 the broad superconducting (SC) dome in the T−−p phase diagram exhibits its maximum Tc,max=20K at a pressure of only pmax≈0.75GPa. In SrFe1.5Co0.5As2 no superconductivity is observed anymore up to 2.8 GPa. Upon increasing the Co concentration the maximum of the SC dome shifts toward lower pressure accompanied by a decrease in the value of Tc,max. Even though, superconductivity is induced by both tuning methods, Co substitution leads to a much more robust SC state. Our study evidences that in SrFe2−xCoxAs2 both, the effect of pressure and Co substitution, have to be considered in order to understand the SC phase-diagram and further attests the close relationship of SrFe2As2 and its sister compound BaFe2As2.},

Here we report precision measurements of its superconducting electrodynamics, at frequencies of 202 and 658 MHz and at temperatures down to 0.1 K. The quasiparticle conductivity reveals a rapid collapse in scattering on entering the superconducting state that is strongly reminiscent of unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, organics and the heavy fermion material CeCoIn 5 . At the lowest temperatures the quasiparticle mean free path exceeds 50 μ m, a record for a compound superconductor. From the superfluid response we confirm the importance of multiband superconductivity and reveal strong evidence for a non-zero energy-gap minimum.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Based on a two-band model, we theoretically study the electronic Raman scattering spectra in both normal and superconducting states of iron-pnictide Ba ( Fe 1 - x Co x ) 2 As 2 superconductors. In the normal state, due to the match or mismatch of band hybridization and Raman vertex symmetries, overall B 2 g Raman intensity is found to be much stronger than that of the B 1 g channel. Besides, in the non-resonant limit, there could exhibit an interband excitation peak at high frequency ω ≃ 7.3 t 1 ( 6.8 t 1 ) in the B 1 g ( B 2 g ) channel with t 1 the nearest-neighbor hopping. In the superconducting state, due to the composite effect of Raman vertex, gap symmetry, and Fermi surface topology, both B 1 g and B 2 g Raman intensities are dominated by α - ( β -) band contribution for the extended s-wave ( d x 2 - y 2 -wave) pairing, whereas both bands are equally important for the s ± -wave pairing. It is shown that both extended s- and s ± -wave pairings can lead to a good fitting for the reported B 1 g data Muschler et al. (2009) [11], while the d x 2 - y 2 -wave pairing seems not favorable.},

  Abstract                 = {FeSe superconductors and their related systems have attracted much attention in the study of iron-based superconductors owing to their simple crystal structure and peculiar electronic and physical properties. The bulk FeSe superconductor has a superconducting transition temperature ( T c ) of ∼8 K and it can be dramatically enhanced to 37 K at high pressure. On the other hand, its cousin system, FeTe, possesses a unique antiferromagnetic ground state but is non-superconducting. Substitution of Se with Te in the FeSe superconductor results in an enhancement of T c up to 14.5 K and superconductivity can persist over a large composition range in the Fe(Se,Te) system. Intercalation of the FeSe superconductor leads to the discovery of the A x Fe 2− y Se 2 (A = K, Cs and Tl) system that exhibits a T c higher than 30 K and a unique electronic structure of the superconducting phase. A recent report of possible high temperature superconductivity in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO 3 films with a T c above 65 K has generated much excitement in the community. This pioneering work opens a door for interface superconductivity to explore for high T c superconductors. The distinct electronic structure and superconducting gap, layer-dependent behavior and insulator–superconductor transition of the FeSe/SrTiO 3 films provide critical information in understanding the superconductivity mechanism of iron-based superconductors. In this paper, we present a brief review of the investigation of the electronic structure and superconductivity of the FeSe superconductor and related systems, with a particular focus on the FeSe films.},

  Abstract                 = {The electronic structure and magnetism of a new magnetic intercalation compound (Li 0.8 Fe 0.2 )OHFeSe are investigated theoretically. The electronic structure calculations predict that the Fe in the (Li,Fe)OH intercalated layer is in a +2 valence state, i.e. there is electron doping to the FeSe layer, resulting in the shrinking of the Fermi surface (FS) pocket around Γ and a strong suppression of dynamical spin susceptibility at M in comparison with the bulk FeSe compound. The ground state of the FeSe layer is a striped antiferromagnetic (SAFM) metal, while the (Li,Fe)OH layer displays a very weak localized magnetism, with an interlayer ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the FeSe and intercalated (Li,Fe)OH layers. Moreover, the (Li,Fe)OH is more than a block layer; it is responsible for enhancing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation in the FeSe layer through interlayer magnetic coupling. We propose that the magnetic spacer layer introduces a tuning mechanism for spin fluctuations associated with superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.},

In the paramagnetic tetragonal phase of BaFe2−xTxAs2 (where T is Co or Ni) iron pnictides, an in-plane resistivity anisotropy has been observed. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to show that low-energy spin excitations in these materials change from fourfold symmetric to twofold symmetric at temperatures corresponding to the onset of the in-plane resistivity anisotropy. Because resistivity and spin excitation anisotropies both vanish near optimal superconductivity, we conclude that they are likely intimately connected.},

  abstract  = {Iron selenide superconductors exhibit a number of unique characteristics that are helpful for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in high-Tc iron-based superconductors more generally. However, in the case of AxFe2Se2 (A =  K, Rb, Cs), the presence of an intergrown antiferromagnetic insulating phase makes the study of the underlying physics problematic. Moreover, FeSe-based systems intercalated with alkali metal ions, NH3 molecules or organic molecules are extremely sensitive to air, which prevents the further investigation of their physical properties. It is therefore desirable to find a stable and easily accessible FeSe-based superconductor to study its physical properties in detail. Here, we report the synthesis of an air-stable material, (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe, which remains superconducting at temperatures up to ~40 K, by means of a novel hydrothermal method. The crystal structure is unambiguously determined by a combination of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, antiferromagnetic order is shown to coexist with superconductivity. This synthetic route opens a path for exploring superconductivity in other related systems, and confirms the appeal of iron selenides as a platform for understanding superconductivity in iron pnictides more broadly.},

For the parent compound as well as for x =0.025, we observe the opening of a pseudogap, due to the spin-density-wave phase transition and inducing a reshuffling of spectral weight from low to high frequencies. For compounds with 0.051≤ x ≤0.11, we detect the superconducting gap, while at x =0.18 the material stays metallic at all temperatures. We describe the effective metallic contribution to the optical conductivity with two Drude terms, representing the combination of a coherent and an incoherent component, and extract the respective scattering rates. We establish that the dc transport properties in the normal phase are dominated by the coherent Drude term for 0≤ x ≤0.051 and by the incoherent one for 0.061≤ x ≤0.18, respectively. Finally, through spectral weight arguments, we give clear-cut evidence of moderate electronic correlations for 0≤ x ≤0.061, which then cross over to values appropriate for a regime of weak interacting and nearly-free electron metals for x ≥0.11.},

The samples have sizes up to 4 mm with flat and shiny surfaces. The x-ray diffraction patterns suggest that they have high crystalline quality and c -axis orientation. The non-superconducting crystals show a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability at about 173 and 135 K for the Sr-based and Ba-based compound, respectively. After doping K as the hole dopant into the BaFe 2 As 2 system, the SDW transition is smeared, and superconducting samples of the compound Ba 1− x K x Fe 2 As 2 (0< x ≤0.4) are obtained. The superconductors, characterized by AC susceptibility and resistivity measurements, exhibit very sharp superconducting transitions at about 36, 32, 27 and 23 K for x = 0.40,0.28,0.25 and 0.23, respectively.},

The Ratio of Stokes to anti-Stokes intensities could be fit with exp(ω/T) with the values of T substantially larger than the temperatures in the cryostat. We explain this result by laser heating of the sample to an extent consistent with thermal conductivity data. Similarly to the YBa2Cu3O7, slope of the low energy part of the continuum in Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 increases with decreasing temperature above Tc and decreases with decreasing temperature below Tc.},

We observed some characteristic changes of the magnitude and the orientation of the magnetic field at the muon site which, due to the fairly high point symmetry of the latter, allow us to identify the magnetic structure of the t-AF state.

While the superconducting transition remains incomplete in the polycrystalline sample, a clear pressure-induced superconductivity with zero resistivity at the expense of magnetic transition, associated with spin density wave (SDW), is observed in the single-crystal sample. The superconducting transition temperature ( T C ) is seen to increase upto a moderate pressure of about ~1.5 GPa and decreases monotonically beyond this pressure. The SDW transition temperature T SDW decreases rapidly with increasing pressure and vanishes above ~1.5 GPa.},

  Abstract                 = {The determination of the most appropriate starting point for the theoretical description of Fe-based materials hosting high-temperature superconductivity remains among the most important unsolved problem in this relatively new field. Most of the work to date has focused on the pnictides, with LaFeAsO, BaFe 2 As 2 and LiFeAs being representative parent compounds of three families known as 1111, 122 and 111, respectively. This topical review examines recent progress in this area, with particular emphasis on the implication of experimental data which have provided evidence for the presence of electron itinerancy and the detection of local spin moments. In light of the results presented, the necessity of a theoretical framework contemplating the presence and the interplay between itinerant electrons and large spin moments is discussed. It is argued that the physics at the heart of the macroscopic properties of pnictides Fe-based high-temperature superconductors appears to be far more complex and interesting than initially predicted.},

Qualitatively, they are in agreement, but the theory predicts density at higher energies. From the DOS, we derive elastic and thermodynamic parameters of iron, including shear modulus, compressional and shear velocities, heat capacity, entropy, kinetic energy, zero-point energy, and Debye temperature. In comparison to the compressional and shear velocities from the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM) seismic model, our results suggest that Earth{quoteright}s inner core has a mean atomic number equal to or higher than pure iron, which is consistent with an iron-nickel alloy.},

  abstract  = {The spontaneous appearance of nematicity, a state of matter that breaks rotation but not translation symmetry, is one of the most intriguing properties of the iron-based superconductors (Fe SC), and has relevance for the cuprates as well. Establishing the critical electronic modes behind nematicity remains a challenge, however, because their associated susceptibilities are not easily accessible by conventional probes. Here, using FeSe as a model system, and symmetry-resolved electronic Raman scattering as a probe, we unravel the presence of critical charge nematic fluctuations near the structural/nematic transition temperature, TS∼ 90 K. The diverging behavior of the associated nematic susceptibility foretells the presence of a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface with d-wave symmetry. The excellent scaling between the observed nematic susceptibility and elastic modulus data demonstrates that the structural distortion is driven by this d-wave Pomeranchuk transition. Our results make a strong case for charge-induced nematicity in FeSe.},

  Abstract                 = {Maximizing the sustainable supercurrent density, JC, is crucial to high-current applications of superconductivity. To achieve this, preventing dissipative motion of quantized vortices is key. Irradiation of superconductors with high-energy heavy ions can be used to create nanoscale defects that act as deep pinning potentials for vortices. This approach holds unique promise for high-current applications of iron-based superconductors because JC amplification persists to much higher radiation doses than in cuprate superconductors without significantly altering the superconducting critical temperature. However, for these compounds, virtually nothing is known about the atomic-scale interplay of the crystal damage from the high-energy ions, the superconducting order parameter, and the vortex pinning processes. We visualize the atomic-scale effects of irradiating FeSexTe1-x with 249-MeV Au ions and find two distinct effects: compact nanometer-sized regions of crystal disruption or {quotedblleft}columnar defects,{quotedblright} plus a higher density of single atomic site {quotedblleft}point{quotedblright} defects probably from secondary scattering. We directly show that the superconducting order is virtually annihilated within the former and suppressed by the latter. Simultaneous atomically resolved images of the columnar crystal defects, the superconductivity, and the vortex configurations then reveal how a mixed pinning landscape is created, with the strongest vortex pinning occurring at metallic core columnar defects and secondary pinning at clusters of point-like defects, followed by collective pinning at higher fields.Keywords},

The results give a Gr{\"u}neisen parameter γ0 = 1.68 ({pm}0.20) and q = 0.7 ({pm}0.5). Phenomenological modeling shows that the Raman-active mode can be approximately correlated with an acoustic phonon and thus provides direct information about the high-pressure elastic properties of iron, which have been controversial. In particular, the C 44 elastic modulus is found to be lower than previous determinations. This leads to changes of about 35\% at core pressures for shear wave anisotropies.},

  Abstract                 = {Subject of this dissertation is the investigation with experimental means of how the Raman response of three structurally similar materials - MgB2, NbSe2, and CaC6- is affected by superconductivity (all three), charge ordering (NbSe2), or crystalline order-to-disorder phase transitions (CaC6). Universal characteristics of spectral renormalization pertaining to the superconducting phase transition are observed in all three compounds. Yet, the crystalline and electronic structures are sufficiently distinct, such that specific for each compound characteristics are imposed on this superconductivity-induced renormalization. Consequently, the method of polarized Raman scattering has been used to establish a variety of physical concepts: 1. Multi-band superconductivity in the layered superconductor MgB2 and its primary mediation by the strongly coupled 640 cm-1 E2g phonon. Additionally, it is shown how a Josephson-like coupling of two SC condensates in the reciprocal space is responsible for an exotic collective mode, the Leggett's resonance. 2. The Interplay between the superconducting and the incommensurate charge-density-wave order parameters in NbSe2, which has been found to be consistent with an isotropic multi-band superconductivity scenario. This scenario is proposed in the frame of a picture that involves a combined "superconductivity plus charge-density-wave" order parameter. 3. The Fano-Breit-Wigner line-shape formalism to account for an anti-resonance interference in the low temperature Raman response from NbSe2 in the polarization geometry corresponding to the non-symmetric E2g symmetry channel. 4. Validity of the double resonant Raman scattering picture in the presence of disorder in the graphite intercalation compound CaC6. Simultaneously, it is explored how disorder suppresses superconductivity. To that end, the CaC6 superconducting coherence peak, too, is presented. All these phenomena are manifestations of electron-phonon coupling in solids. It is probed by inelastic light scattering under the specific constraints of respective crystalline symmetries. Each case, therefore, remains intriguingly unique. The experiments have been performed in a state of the art optical laboratory with low temperatures and high magnetic fields infrastructure, of which a detailed account is given.},

  abstract  = {A polycrystalline sample of FeSe, which adopts the tetragonal PbO-type structure (P4/nmm) at room temperature, has been prepared using solid state reaction. We have investigated pressure-induced structural changes in tetragonal FeSe at varying hydrostatic pressures up to 0.6 GPa in the orthorhombic (T=50 K) and tetragonal (T=190 K) phases using high resolution neutron powder diffraction. We report that the structure is quite compressible with a Bulk modulus ≈31 GPa to 33 GPa and that the pressure response is anisotropic with a larger compressibility along the c -axis. Key bond angles of the SeFe4 pyramids and FeSe4 tetrahedra are also determined as a function of pressure.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of the Raman scattering of light by the optical-vibration modes of polyatomic metals is presented. A microscopic theory has been developed which describes the modulation of the electronic susceptibility tensor χμν(ω) by long wavelength optical phonons. The various mechanisms which contribute to the Raman tensor are discussed. The theory of inelastic scattering of light by a semi-infinite opaque medium has been formulated. We apply the theory to describe the spectrum of light scattered by both even- and odd-parity optical modes of long wavelength. An estimate of the strength of the scattering has been made for two cases, and is compared with experimental results of Feldman, Parker, and Ashkin.},

Recently, it was shown that electron irradiation, which creates pointlike potential scattering defects, has the surprising effect of enhancing T c while suppressing T s . Here we discuss a possible scenario for such an effect, which postulates a competition between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/10/103001/njpaa3bf2ieqn3.gif] {${s}_{\pm }$} superconductivity and nematic order. The transition to the nematic state is modeled by a mean field theory of a d -wave Pomeranchuk instability, together with a Cooper pairing interaction in both one- and multiband models. The effect of nonmagnetic impurities on both orders is treated on equal footing within the Born approximation. We find evidence that disorder can indeed enhance T c while suppressing the competing nematic order, but only in a multiband situation. We discuss our results in the context of experimental data on FeSe crystals.},

The plate side of the crystal is identified to be the (101) face of the tetragonal α-FeSe. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) measurements show that Mn substitutes for Fe. Both types of crystals show a superconducting transition at 8 K in the DC magnetization measurements and a broad resistive transition with zero resistance at 7.5 K with an onset at 11 K. Specific heat measurements also confirm bulk superconductivity in the crystals. Crystals could also be grown using KBr as a solvent.},

These results suggest that the effects of vdW interaction on layered superconductors are often essential although they depend on the characters of the interlayer couplings.},

Low-energy tunable excitation photons have allowed the first observation of three-dimensional saddle-point dispersion at the Z point, as well as the Γ point. This resolves a discrepancy in Fermi-surface studies. We found that these van Hove singularities are not only involved in three-dimensional Fermi-surface reconstruction with antiferromagnetic ordering but also renormalized and predominant at low energies. Hence, the Fermi-surface instability due to these singularities would also underlie the associated superconductors.},

The identification and characterization of FeSe0.88 samples were determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The electrical transport, magnetic and thermal transport properties of the obtained samples were also investigated. The results showed that the sensitivity of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility depends on heating cycles while the structural formation of samples does not. The upper critical field Hc2(0) has been determined with the magnetic field parallel to the sample surface and yielding a maximum value of 23.2&} # xa0;T. At the zero field coherence length, ξ, value was calculated
	to be 3.33& #{xa0;nm. Calculated μ0Hc2(0)/kBTc rate indicated comparably higher value (3.17&} # xa0;T/K) than the Pauli limit (1.84& #{xa0;T/K) and obtained results were suggested unconventional nature of superconductivity in our samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Symmetric Lorentzian and asymmetric Fano line shapes are fundamental spectroscopic signatures that quantify the structural and dynamical properties of nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids. This study introduces a universal temporal-phase formalism, mapping the Fano asymmetry parameter q to a phase ϕ of the time-dependent dipole response function. The formalism is confirmed experimentally by laser-transforming Fano absorption lines of autoionizing helium into Lorentzian lines after attosecond-pulsed excitation. We also demonstrate the inverse, the transformation of a naturally Lorentzian line into a Fano profile. A further application of this formalism uses quantum-phase control to amplify extreme-ultraviolet light resonantly interacting with He atoms. The quantum phase of excited states and its response to interactions can thus be extracted from line-shape analysis, with applications in many branches of spectroscopy.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We report on electrical resistivity, magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall effect measurements in four non-superconducting BaFe 2 − x \{TMxAs2\} (TM = Mn, Cu and Ni) single crystals with small values of the chemical substitution x. The spin density wave (SDW) ordering that occurs in these systems at temperatures T ∼ (120–140) K, in close vicinity to a tetragonal/orthorhombic transition, produces significant modifications in their magneto-transport properties. While in the magnetically ordered phase the \{MR\} is positive and its magnitude increases with decreasing temperatures, in the paramagnetic regime the \{MR\} becomes vanishingly small. Above the spin density wave transition temperature (TSDW) the Hall coefficient \{RH\} is negative, small and weakly temperature dependent, but a remarkable change of slope occurs in the \{RH\} versus T curves at T = T \{SDW\} . The Hall coefficient amplitude, while remaining negative, increases steadily and significantly as the temperature is decreased below \{TSDW\} and down to T = 20 K. The qualitative behavior of both \{MR\} and Hall coefficient is weakly dependent on the chemical substitution in the studied limit. The experiments provide strong evidence that scattering of charge carriers by magnetic excitations has to be taken into account to explain the behavior of the resistivity, magnetoresistance and Hall effect in the ordered phase of the studied compounds. Effects of multiple band conduction also must be considered for a complete interpretation of the results.},

While BaFe2As2 remains metallic at all temperatures, we observe a depletion in the far infrared energy interval of the optical conductivity below TSDW, ascribed to the formation of a pseudogap-like feature in the excitation spectrum. This is accompanied by the narrowing of the Drude term consistent with the dc transport results and suggestive of suppression of scattering channels in the SDW state. About 20{\%} of the spectral weight in the far infrared energy interval is affected by the SDW phase transition.},

In Sharvin-type nanocontacts, two sets of subharmonic gap structures were detected due to multiple Andreev reflections, indicating the existence of two nodeless superconducting gaps $\Delta$ L = (2.75 {\textpm} 0.3) meV and $\Delta$ S = (0.8 {\textpm} 0.2) meV. Well-shaped CVCs for stacks of Andreev contacts with up to five contacts were observed due to the layered structure of FeSe (the intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect). An additional fine structure in the CVCs of Andreev ScS nanocontacts is attributed to the existence of a Leggett mode. A linear relation between the superconducting gap $\Delta$ L and the magnetic resonance energy E magres ≈ 2$\Delta$ L is found to be valid for layered iron pnictides.},

We detected two subharmonic gap structures related with multiple Andreev reflections, indicating the presence of two superconducting gaps with the BCS-ratios 2$\Delta$ L /k B T C =4.2{\textdiv}5.9 and 2$\Delta$ S /k B T C ∼1≪3.52, respectively. Temperature dependences of the two gaps $\Delta$ L,S (T) in FeSe indicate a k-space proximity effect between two superconducting condensates. For the studied iron-based superconductors, we found a linear relation between the gap $\Delta$ L and magnetic resonance energy, E res≈2$\Delta$ L .},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of London penetration depth, a sensitive tool to study multiband superconductivity, have provided several important insights into the behavior of Fe-based superconductors. We first briefly review the 'experimentalist-friendly' self-consistent Eilenberger two-band model that relates the measurable superfluid density and temperature dependences of the superconducting gaps. Then we focus on BaFe 2 As 2 -derived materials, for which the results are consistent with (1) two distinct superconducting gaps; (2) development of strong in-plane gap anisotropy with departure from optimal doping; (3) development of gap nodes along the c direction in a highly overdoped regime; (4) significant pair-breaking, presumably due to charge doping; (5) fully gapped intrinsic behavior (exponential at low temperatures) at optimal doping if the scattering is removed (probed in the 'self-doped' stoichiometric LiFeAs); (6) competition between the magnetically ordered state and superconductivity, which do coexist in underdoped compounds. Overall, it appears that while there are common trends in the behavior of Fe-based superconductors, the gap structure is non-universal and is quite sensitive to the doping level. It is plausible that the rich variety of possible gap structures within the general s ± framework is responsible for the observed behavior.},

The J c in the wire at 4.2 K has reached 37 kA/cm 2 under self-field and 3.0 kA/cm 2 at 90 kOe. Magneto-optical imaging of the wire confirmed the large intergranular J c in the wire core.},

  Abstract                 = {The nature of the pairing state in iron-based superconductors is the subject of much debate. Here we argue that in one material, the stoichiometric iron pnictide KFe 2 As 2 , there is overwhelming evidence for a d-wave pairing state, characterized by symmetry-imposed vertical line nodes in the superconducting gap. This evidence is reviewed, with a focus on thermal conductivity and the strong impact of impurity scattering on the critical temperature T c . We then compare KFe 2 As 2 to Ba 0.6 K 0.4 Fe 2 As 2 , obtained by Ba substitution, where the pairing symmetry is s-wave and the T c is ten times higher. The transition from d-wave to s-wave within the same crystal structure provides a rare opportunity to investigate the connection between band structure and the pairing mechanism. We also compare KFe 2 As 2 with the nodal iron-based superconductor LaFePO, for which the pairing symmetry is probably not d-wave, but more likely s-wave with accidental line nodes.},

We show that while Fermi-surface-driven pairing mechanisms fail to provide a universal scheme for the Fe-based superconductors, theoretical approaches based on short-range interactions lead to a more robust and universal description of superconductivity in these materials. Our findings are also discussed in the broader context of unconventional superconductivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Superconductivity in the iron pnictides is often closely connected to a nematic state in which the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal is spontaneously broken. Determining the dominant interactions responsible for this symmetry breaking is essential to understanding the superconducting state. Here, we use atomic-resolution variable-temperature scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to probe the nanoscale electronic structure of the nematically ordered, parent pnictide NaFeAs and compare it with non-nematic LiFeAs. Local electronic nematicity is only manifest in NaFeAs and is found to persist to high temperatures in the nominally tetragonal phase of the crystal. The spatial distribution and energy dependence of the electronic anisotropy at high temperatures is explained by the persistence of large-amplitude, short-range, unidirectional, antiferroic fluctuations, indicating that strong density-wave fluctuations exist and couple to near-Fermi surface electrons even far from the structural and density-wave phase boundaries.},

  abstract  = {Abstract An important feature of the iron-based pnictides is their multi-band electronic structure with both electron and hole bands at the Fermi level. The size of these pockets can be changed by different types of substitution, resulting in a variety of original magnetic and electronic properties. The contributions of both types of carriers will thus have important consequences on the evolution of the transport properties versus temperature and doping. It has been pointed out that Hund's rule interaction plays a prominent role in the physics of these compounds by allowing a strong orbital differentiation between the 3d Fe orbitals. As a result, a description in terms of more or less correlated electrons was proposed and may have important consequences on the scattering lifetimes of the different carriers. Finally, the presence of very flat bands at the Fermi level may induce a semiconductor-like behavior, with a change in carrier concentration with temperature. In this paper, we will review the evolution of transport properties with chemical doping/substitution in iron pnictides. We will more particularly focus on the 122 family (Ba(Sr,Ca)Fe2As2) and the 111 LiFeAs compound for which sizeable single crystals required for transport measurements are available. The combined resistivity, Hall effect and magnetoresistance data will be analyzed in association with electronic structure calculations, angle-resolved photoemission measurements and quantum oscillations. In spite of the strong interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in most part of their phase diagram, direct signatures of spin fluctuations are difficult to identify in the transport properties of iron pnictides. We will show that measurements of the longitudinal magnetoresistance provide a powerful tool for studying the coupling between the charge carriers and the spin degrees of freedom.},

We reveal the pseudogap in the electronic Raman spectra in the B 1 g and B 2 g geometries. In these geometries we probe respectively, the antinodal (AN) and nodal (N) regions corresponding to the principal axes and the diagonal of the Brillouin zone. The pseudogap appears in underdoped regime and manifests itself in the B 1 g spectra by a strong depletion of the low energy electronic continuum as the temperature decreases. We define a temperature T * below which the depletion appears and the pseudogap energy, ω PG the energy at which the depeletion closes. The pseudogap is also present in the B 2 g spectra but the depletion opens at higher energy than in the B 1 g spectra. We observe the creation of new electronic states inside the depletion as we enter the superconducting phase. This leads us to conclude (as proposed by S. Sakai et al. [1]) that the pseudogap has a different structure than the superconducting gap and competes with it. We show that the nodal quasiparticle dynamic is very robust and almost insensitive to the pseudogap phase contrary to the antinodal quasiparticle dynamic. We finally reveal, in contrast to what it is usually admitted, an increase of the nodal quasiparticle spectral weight with underdoping. We interpret this result as the consequence of a possible Fermi surface disturbances in the doping range p = 0.1 − 0.2.},

We begin by looking theoretically at why this type of pairing might be favored in a strongly correlated system with a short-range Coulomb interaction. Then we turn to the experimental question of how one would know if dx2 − y2 pairing were present.},

  Abstract                 = {Just after the discovery of the iron based superconductors (iron pnictides) important differences from the conventional as well as to the high temperature superconducting cuprates were found. The complex band structure (multiple energy gaps, the unconventional symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and the unknown nature of the Cooper pair coupling mechanism) results in interesting new properties of these materials. This review summarizes the status of theoretical and experimental results on Josephson effects in the iron pnictides connected to these unusual properties. On one hand the investigation of Josephson effects can be a helpful tool to determine these properties and to test different theoretical models, but on the other hand these properties may lead to new kinds of Josephson junctions and future applications.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the central questions about the iron pnictides concerns the extent to which their electrons are strongly correlated. Here, we address this issue through the phenomenology of the charge transport and dynamics, the single-electron excitation spectrum, and magnetic ordering and dynamics. We outline the evidence that the parent compounds, while metallic, have electron interactions that are sufficiently strong to produce incipient Mott physics. In other words, in terms of the strength of electron correlations compared with the kinetic energy, the iron pnictides are closer to intermediately coupled systems lying at the boundary between itinerancy and localization, such as V 2 O 3 or Se-doped NiS 2 , rather than to simple antiferromagnetic metals like Cr. This level of electronic correlations produces a new small parameter for controlled theoretical analysis, namely the fraction of the single-electron spectral weight that lies in the coherent part of the excitation spectrum. Using this expansion parameter, we construct the effective low-energy Hamiltonian and discuss its implications for the magnetic order and magnetic quantum criticality. Finally, this approach sharpens the notion of magnetic frustration for such a metallic system, and brings about a multiband matrix t – J 1 – J 2 model for the carrier-doped iron pnictides.},

Our results show that (i) a small amount of excess Fe substantially disorders the Fe-derived bands while an Se deficiency affects mainly the Se-derived bands, (ii) the substitution of S or Te enhances the possibility of Fermi surface nesting, especially in FeSe 0.5 Te 0.5 , in spite of disordering the Se-derived bands and (iii) the electron doping through Co, Ni or Cu disorders the system and pushes down the Fe-derived bands, thereby destroying the possibility of Fermi surface nesting. A comparison of these results with the rigid-band, virtual-crystal and supercell approximations reveals the importance of describing disorder with the coherent-potential approximation.},

  Abstract                 = {The issue concerning the nature and the role of microstructural inhomogeneities in iron chalcogenide superconducting crystals of FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35 and their correlation with transport properties of this system was addressed. The presented data demonstrate that chemical disorder originating from the kinetics of the crystal growth process significantly influences the superconducting properties of an Fe–Te–Se system. Transport measurements of the transition temperature and critical current density performed for microscopic bridges allow us to deduce the local properties of a superconductor with microstructural inhomogeneities, and significant differences were noted. The variances observed in the local properties were explained as a consequence of weak superconducting links existing in the studied crystals. The results confirm that the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of ions and small hexagonal symmetry nanoscale regions with nanoscale phase separation also seem to enhance the superconductivity in this system with respect to the values of the critical current density. Magnetic measurements performed in order to determine, in an alternative way, the values of the critical current density, as well as to find the relaxation rate and to check the scaling of the pinning force, confirm the conclusions drawn from the transport measurements.},

The twofold pairing symmetry was further supported by the observation of striped electronic nanostructures in the slightly Se-doped samples. The anisotropy can be explained in terms of the orbital-dependent reconstruction of electronic structure in FeSe.},

XRD patterns showed two new high pressure phases (named phases II and III). From a Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns of α-Sb2Te3, the unit cell volume as a function of pressure was obtained and the values were fitted to a Birch–Murnaghan equation of state (BM-EOS). The best fit was obtained for bulk modulus B0=36.1±0.9GPa and its derivative B0′=6.2±0.4 (not fixed). Using the refined structural data for α-Sb2Te3, for pressures up to 9.8GPa, changes in the angle of succession [Te–Sb–Te–Sb–Te], in the interaromic distances of Sb and Te atoms belonging to this angle of succession and in the interatomic distances of atoms located on the c axis were examined. This analysis revealed an electronic topological transition (ETT) along the a and c axes at close to 3.7GPa. From the RS spectra, the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the Raman active modes of α-Sb2Te3 were plotted as functions of pressure and showed an ETT along the a and c axes at close to 3.2GPa. The XRD patterns of phases II and III were well reproduced assuming β-Bi2Te3 and γ-Bi2Te3 structures similar to those reported in the literature for α-Bi2Te3.},

Application of the models during the last two decades provided an explanation of the paired states in correlated fermion systems and thus essentially extended their earlier usage to the description of itinerant magnetism, fluctuating valence, and the metal-insulator transition. We also present some of the new results concerning the unconventional superconductivity obtained very recently in our group. A comparison with experiment is also discussed, but the main emphasis is put on rationalization of the superconducting properties of those materials within the real-space pairing mechanism based on either kinetic exchange and/or Kondo-type interaction combined with the electron correlation effects.},

  abstract  = {In the past 10 years, iron-based superconductors have created more puzzles than they have helped resolve. Some of the most fundamental outstanding questions are how strong the interactions are and what the electron pairing mechanism is. Now two groups have made contributions toward resolving these questions in the intriguing compound iron selenide (FeSe) (see the Perspective by Lee). Gerber et al. used photoemission spectroscopy coupled with x-ray diffraction to find that FeSe has a very sizable electron-phonon interaction. Quasiparticle interference imaging helped Sprau et al. determine the shape of the superconducting gap and find that the electron pairing in FeSe is orbital-selective.Science, this issue p. 71, p. 75; see also p. 32The superconductor iron selenide (FeSe) is of intense interest owing to its unusual nonmagnetic nematic state and potential for high-temperature superconductivity. But its Cooper pairing mechanism has not been determined. We used Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging to determine the Fermi surface geometry of the electronic bands surrounding the Γ = (0, 0) and X = (π/aFe, 0) points of FeSe and to measure the corresponding superconducting energy gaps. We show that both gaps are extremely anisotropic but nodeless and that they exhibit gap maxima oriented orthogonally in momentum space. Moreover, by implementing a novel technique, we demonstrate that these gaps have opposite sign with respect to each other. This complex gap configuration reveals the existence of orbital-selective Cooper pairing that, in FeSe, is based preferentially on electrons from the dyz orbitals of the iron atoms.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the form of orbital ordering in the electronic nematic phase of iron-based superconductors by applying a group theoretical analysis on a realistic five-band model. We find the orbital order can be either of the inter-orbital s-wave form or intra-orbital d-wave form. From the comparison with existing ARPES measurements of band splitting, we find the orbital ordering in the 122 system is dominated by an intra-orbital d-wave component, while that of the 111 system is dominated by an inter-orbital s-wave component. We find both forms of orbital order are strongly entangled with the nematicity in the spin correlation of the system. The condensation energy of the magnetic ordered phase is found to be significantly improved (by more than 20%) when the degeneracy between the ( π , 0) and (0, π ) ordering pattern is lifted by the orbital order. We argue there should be a large difference in both the scattering rate and the size of the possible pseudogap on the electron pocket around the X = ( π , 0) and Y = (0, π ) point in the electronic nematic phase. We propose this as a possible origin for the observed nematicity in resistivity measurements.},

The value of J c for FeSe is enhanced by more than a factor of 2 after 3-MeV H + irradiation, which is explained by the introduction of point pinning centers. Vortex creep rates are found to be strongly suppressed after irradiation. Detailed analyses of the pinning energy based on collective-creep-theory and an extended Maley’s method show that the H + irradiation enhances the value of J c before the flux creep and also reduces the size of the flux bundle, which suppresses the field dependence of J c owing to vortex motion.},

  abstract  = {The coexistence and competition between superconductivity and electronic orders, such as spin or charge density waves, have been a central issue in high transition-temperature (Tc) superconductors. Unlike other iron-based superconductors, FeSe exhibits nematic ordering without magnetism whose relationship with its superconductivity remains unclear. Moreover, a pressure-induced fourfold increase of Tc has been reported, which poses a profound mystery. Here we report high-pressure magnetotransport measurements in FeSe up to [sim]15[thinsp]GPa, which uncover the dome shape of magnetic phase superseding the nematic order. Above [sim]6[thinsp]GPa the sudden enhancement of superconductivity (Tc[le]38.3[thinsp]K) accompanies a suppression of magnetic order, demonstrating their competing nature with very similar energy scales. Above the magnetic dome, we find anomalous transport properties suggesting a possible pseudogap formation, whereas linear-in-temperature resistivity is observed in the normal states of the high-Tc phase above 6[thinsp]GPa. The obtained phase diagram highlights unique features of FeSe among iron-based superconductors, but bears some resemblance to that of high-Tc cuprates.},

With this application in mind, we briefly review the ground-state physical properties of corundum (α-Al2O3) with some emphasis on its behavior under high pressure, survey the effects of temperature and stress on the R-line luminescence of ruby (Cr-doped corundum), and address the recent efforts towards an improved calibration of the R-line shift under hydrostatic pressures beyond the 50 GPa mark.},

Whereas in-plane arsenic zigzag chains were found in the 112-type superconducting iron arsenide Ca1–xLaxFeAs2 with maximum Tc = 34 K, deformed arsenic network structures appeared in other 112-type materials, such as longitudinal arsenic zigzag chains in CaFe1–yPdyAs2 (y ∼ 0.51) and arsenic square sheets constructed via hypervalent bonding in Ca1–xLaxFe1–yPdyAs2 (x ∼ 0.31, y ∼ 0.30). As K-edge XANES spectra clarified the similar oxidization states around FeAs4 tetrahedrons, alluding to possible parents for high-Tc 112-type iron arsenide superconductors.},

  abstract  = {The electronic Raman effect has been studied in single crystals of Y1−xCaxBa2Cu3O6 (Y-123) and La 2 - x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) at different doping. The experimental results provide evidences of an anomalous contribution to the response at low energies and temperatures. In \{LSCO\} the additional excitation is in \{B2g\} symmetry for x = 0.02 and in \{B1g\} symmetry for x = 0.10. In Y-123, we observed the additional feature in \{B2g\} symmetry at 1.5% doping. Mainly on the basis of the selection rules we conclude that the additional peaks are the response of a dynamical charge modulation (stripes) in the two-dimensional CuO2 planes. The selection rules allow us to determine the orientation of the stripes to be along the diagonal of the CuO2 planes in Y-123 and \{LSCO\} at x = 0.02, and along the principal axes in \{LSCO\} at x = 0.10.},

  Abstract                 = {While in strongly correlated materials one often focuses on local electronic correlations, the influence of non-local exchange and correlation effects beyond band-theory can be pertinent in systems with more extended orbitals. Thus in many compounds an adequate theoretical description requires the joint treatment of local and non-local self-energies. Here, I will argue that this is the case for the iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors. As an approach to tackle their electronic structure, I will detail the implementation of the recently proposed scheme that combines the quasi-particle self-consistent GW approach with dynamical mean-field theory: QSGW+DMFT. I will showcase the possibilities of QSGW+DMFT with an application on BaFe 2 As 2 . Further, I will discuss the empirical finding that in pnictides dynamical and non-local correlation effects separate within the quasi-particle band-width.},

  Abstract                 = {Planar tunneling junctions of the presumably unconventional superconductor FeSe were prepared and investigated. The junctions consisted of rf-sputtered FeSe/AlO x /Ag multilayers patterned lithographically into mesa structures. Bias voltage-dependent differential conductivities dI/dV(V) of junctions in the tunneling, intermediate barrier strength, and metallic regimes were investigated. Depending on the barrier type between two to four features of the conductivity were obtained, which are discussed in the framework of multiple superconducting energy gaps. Specifically, we reproduced with all barrier types two established energy gaps and identified another feature as presumably originating from an additional large superconducting gap. A further conductivity feature could be associated with a resonant state.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on successful fabrication of superconducting FeSe wire using hot gas extrusion (HGE) ex-situ PIT (powder in tube) method. Length of the obtained wire was about 60cm with cross-sectional superconducting core area nearly 2.5 × 10 −3 cm 2 . For the wire sample we observed superconducting transition temperature, T onset c ≈ 11 K, about 1.2K lower compared to preliminary prepared FeSe powder. Heat treatment in argon atmosphere at 350 o C resulted in transition width decrease from Δ T (10% − 90%) ≈ 1.75 K in sample without heat treatment down to Δ T ≈ 0.9 K in annealed samples. Estimated derivative of the upper critical field as a function of temperature of the sample annealed during 72h in argon atmosphere at 350 o C is dH c 2 / dT ~ −2.9 T/K. Applying WHH theory to our data allows to define H c 2 (0 K ) = 0.69 T c × ( dH c 2 / dT ) ≈ 19.8T. The untreated wire shows critical current density, J c ~ 75 A/cm 2 at T=4.0 K in zero field. Increasing annealing time up to 72 hours at 350 o C in argon atmosphere gives rise to J c increase of about 60% approaching 120 A/cm 2 at T=4.0K and H=0T . Also J c measurements were made in magnetic fields up to 9T. Our results show applicability of the HGE PIT method for fabrication of superconducting wires based on FeSe compound. Long-range heat treatment is necessary to improve superconducting properties of the samples.},

Similar to high T c cuprates, the superconductivity in iron arsenide is related to a layered structure. Searching for new superconductors with [FeAs] layer, but of simpler structure will be of scientific significance either to build up new multilayered superconductors that may reach higher T c or to study the mysterious underlined superconducting mechanism in iron arsenide compounds. Here we report that a new superconducting iron arsenide system LiFeAs was found. The compound crystallizes into a structure containing [FeAs] conducting layer that is interlaced with Li charge reservoir. Superconductivity was observed with T c up to 18 K in the compounds.},

  Abstract                 = {In common with other iron-based high-temperature superconductors, FeSe exhibits a transition to a /`nematic[rsquor] phase below 90[thinsp]K in which the crystal rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. However, the absence of strong low-frequency magnetic fluctuations near or above the transition has been interpreted as implying the primacy of orbital ordering. In contrast, we establish that quantum fluctuations of spin-1 local moments with strongly frustrated exchange interactions can lead to a nematic quantum paramagnetic phase consistent with the observations in FeSe. We show that this phase is a fundamental expression of the existence of a Berry[rsquor]s phase associated with the topological defects of a Neel antiferromagnet, in a manner analogous to that which gives rise to valence bond crystal order for spin-1/2 systems. We present an exactly solvable model realizing the nematic quantum paramagnetic phase, discuss its relation with the spin-1 J1-J2 model, and construct a field theory of the Landau-forbidden transition between the Neel state and this nematic quantum paramagnet.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by the recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on FeSe and iron pnictide families of iron-based superconductors, we have studied the orbital nematic order and its interplay with antiferromagnetism within the two-orbital Hubbard model. We used random phase approximation (RPA) to calculate the dependence of the orbital and magnetic susceptibilities on the strength of interactions and electron density (doping). To account for strong electron correlations not captured by RPA, we further employed non-perturbative variational cluster approximation (VCA) capable of capturing symmetry broken magnetic and orbitally ordered phases. Both approaches show that the electron and hole doping affect the two orders differently. While hole doping tends to suppress both magnetism and orbital ordering, the electron doping suppresses magnetism faster. Crucially, we find a realistic parameter regime for moderate electron doping that stabilizes orbital nematicity in the absence of long-range antiferromagnetic order. This is reminiscent of the non-magnetic orbital nematic phase observed recently in FeSe and a number of iron pnictide materials and raises the possibility that at least in some cases, the observed electronic nematicity may be primarily due to orbital rather than magnetic fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {Elucidating the nature of the magnetism of a high-temperature superconductor is crucial for establishing its pairing mechanism. The parent compounds of the cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors exhibit Neel and stripe magnetic order, respectively. However, FeSe, the structurally simplest iron-based superconductor, shows nematic order (Ts=90[thinsp]K), but not magnetic order in the parent phase, and its magnetic ground state is intensely debated. Here we report inelastic neutron-scattering experiments that reveal both stripe and Neel spin fluctuations over a wide energy range at 110[thinsp]K. On entering the nematic phase, a substantial amount of spectral weight is transferred from the Neel to the stripe spin fluctuations. Moreover, the total fluctuating magnetic moment of FeSe is [sim]60% larger than that in the iron pnictide BaFe2As2. Our results suggest that FeSe is a novel S=1 nematic quantum-disordered paramagnet interpolating between the Neel and stripe magnetic instabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {Cuprate high-temperature superconductors consist of two quasi-two-dimensional (2D) substructures: CuO 2 superconducting layers and charge reservoir layers. The superconductivity is realized by charge transfer from the charge reservoir layers into the superconducting layers without chemical dopants and defects being introduced into the latter, similar to modulation-doping in the semiconductor superlattices of AlGaAs/GaAs. Inspired by this scheme, we have been searching for high-temperature superconductivity in ultra-thin films of superconductors epitaxially grown on semiconductor/oxide substrates since 2008. We have observed interface-enhanced superconductivity in both conventional and unconventional superconducting films, including single atomic layer films of Pb and In on Si substrates and single unit cell (UC) films of FeSe on SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates. The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity with a superconducting gap of ∼20 meV in 1UC-FeSe/STO has stimulated tremendous interest in the superconductivity community, for it opens a new avenue for both raising superconducting transition temperature and understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we review mainly the experimental progress on interface-enhanced superconductivity in the three systems mentioned above with emphasis on 1UC-FeSe/STO, studied by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport experiments. We discuss the roles of interfaces and a possible pairing mechanism inferred from these studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Mono- and multilayer FeSe thin films grown on SrTiO 3 and BiTiO 3 substrates exhibit a greatly enhanced superconductivity over that found in bulk FeSe. A number of proposals have been advanced for the mechanism of this enhancement. One possibility is the introduction of a cross-interface electron–phonon (e–ph) interaction between the FeSe electrons and oxygen phonons in the substrates that is peaked in the forward scattering (small ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-2048/29/5/054009/sustaa1beeieqn1.gif] {${\bf{q}})$} direction due to the two-dimensional nature of the interface system. Motivated by this, we explore the consequences of such an interaction on the superconducting state and electronic structure of a two-dimensional system using Migdal–Eliashberg (ME) theory. This interaction produces not only deviations from the expectations of conventional phonon-mediated pairing but also replica structures in the spectral function and density of states, as probed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, and quasiparticle interference imaging. We also discuss the applicability of ME theory for a situation where the e–ph interaction is peaked at small momentum transfer and in the FeSe/STO system.},

Below the structural transition at Ts ∽90 K, the reflectivity spectrum clearly shows a gradual suppression around 400 cm−1 and the conductivity spectrum shows a peak at higher frequency. The energy scale of this gap-like feature is comparable to the width of the band splitting observed by ARPES. The low-frequency conductivity consists of two Drude components and the overall plasma frequency is smaller than that of the FeAs based compounds, suggesting a lower carrier density or stronger correlation effect. The plasma frequency becomes even smaller below Ts which agrees with the very small Fermi energy estimated by other experiments. Similar to iron pnictides, a clear temperature-induced spectral weight transfer is observed for FeSe, being indicative of strong correlation effect.},

  abstract  = {We report high transition temperature superconductivity in one unit-cell (UC) thick FeSe films grown on a Se-etched SrTiO 3 (001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). A superconducting gap as large as 20 meV and the magnetic field induced vortex state revealed by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) suggest that the superconductivity of the 1 UC FeSe films could occur around 77 K. The control transport measurement shows that the onset superconductivity temperature is well above 50 K. Our work not only demonstrates a powerful way for finding new superconductors and for raising T C , but also provides a well-defined platform for systematic studies of the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity by using different superconducting materials and substrates.},

  Abstract                 = {BaFe 2 As 2 (Ba-122) and Ba 0.6 K 0.4 Fe 2 As 2 (K-doped Ba-122) powders were successfully synthesized from the elements using a reaction method that incorporates a mechanochemical reaction using high-impact ball milling. Mechanically activated, self-sustaining reactions (MSRs) were observed while milling the elements together to form these compounds. After the MSR, the Ba-122 phase had formed, the powder had an average grain size <1 μm, and the material was effectively mixed. X-ray diffraction confirmed Ba-122 was the primary phase present after milling. Heat treatment of the K-doped MSR powder at high temperature (1120 ° C) and pressure yielded dense samples with high phase purity, but only granular current flow could be visualized by magneto-optical imaging. In contrast, a short, low temperature (600 ° C) heat treatment at ambient pressure resulted in global current flow throughout the bulk sample even though the density was lower and impurity phases were more prevalent. An optimized heat treatment involving a two-step, low temperature (600 ° C) heat treatment of the MSR powder produced bulk material with very high critical current density above 0.1 MA cm −2 at 4.2 K and self-field (SF).},

We consider changes in the Fermi surface nesting with a vector Q  = (0.5,0.5) × (2 π / a ) as crucial for rising superconductivity (SC) mediated by spin fluctuations (SF). Our results indicate that the c -axis–strained FeSe exhibits the most imperfect nesting, which enhances SF and, hence, also SC. In turn, the ab -plane compressive strain slightly weakens this nesting while the tensile strain destroys it completely. These findings are consistent with earlier reported experimental dependences of the superconducting transition temperatures on strain in FeSe thin films.},

	our study with nominal substitution (≤5& #{xa0;wt%) with other transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V and Ti) in place of excess iron. The Tc is found to increase (maximum ~11&#xa0;K) or get suppressed depending on the substituted transition metal.

Plate-like crystals of the new phase were obtained, and its crystal structure was investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structure was identified as the monoclinic system with space group P21/m, composed of two Ca(Pr) planes, Fe2As2 layers, and As2 zigzag chain layers. Plate-like crystals of the new phase showed superconductivity, with a Tc of ∼20 K in both magnetization and resistivity measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {We study an interacting electronic system exhibiting a spin nematic instability. Using a phenomenological form for the spin fluctuation spectrum near the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase, we compute the spin nematic susceptibility in energy and momentum space as a function of temperature and the magnetic correlation length ξ . The spin nematic instability occurs when ξ reaches a critical value ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/7/073030/njp516631ieqn1.gif] {${\xi }_{\mathrm{cr}}$} , i.e., its transition temperature ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/7/073030/njp516631ieqn2.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{SN}}$} is always higher than the SDW critical temperature ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/7/073030/njp516631ieqn3.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{SDW}}$} . In particular, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/7/073030/njp516631ieqn4.gif] {${\xi }_{\mathrm{cr}}$} decreases monotonically with increasing ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/7/073030/njp516631ieqn5.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{SN}}$} . Concomitantly, low-energy nematic fluctuations are present in a wider temperature region as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/7/073030/njp516631ieqn6.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{SN}}$} becomes higher. Approaching the spin nematic instability, the nematic spectral function at zero momentum exhibits a central peak as a function of energy for a finite temperature and a soft mode at zero temperature. These properties originate from the general feature that the imaginary part of the spin-fluctuation bubble has a term linear in energy and its coefficient is proportional to the square of temperature. Furthermore we find that the nematic spectral function exhibits a diffusive peak around zero momentum and zero energy without clear dispersive features. A possible phase diagram for the spin nematic and SDW transitions is also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Ultrathin FeSe films grown on SrTiO3 substrates are a recent milestone in atomic material engineering due to their important role in understanding unconventional superconductivity in Fe-based materials. By using femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we study phonon frequencies in ultrathin FeSe/SrTiO3 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. After optical excitation, we observe periodic modulations of the photoelectron spectrum as a function of pump–probe delay for 1-unit-cell, 3-unit-cell, and 60-unit-cell thick FeSe films. The frequencies of the coherent intensity oscillations increase from 5.00 ± 0.02 to 5.25 ± 0.02 THz with increasing film thickness. By comparing with previous works, we attribute this mode to the Se A1g phonon. The dominant mechanism for the phonon softening in 1-unit-cell thick FeSe films is a substrate-induced lattice strain. Our results demonstrate an abrupt phonon renormalization due to a lattice mismatch between the ultrathin film and the substrate.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on an effective two-band model and using the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approach, we explore spin fluctuations and unconventional superconducting pairing in Fe-based layer superconductors. It is elaborated that one type of interband antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuation stems from the interband Coulomb repulsion, whereas the other type of intraband AF spin fluctuation originates from the intraband Coulomb repulsion. Due to the Fermi-surface topology, a spin-singlet extended s-wave superconducting state is more favorable than the nodal d XY -wave state if the interband AF spin fluctuation is more significant than the intraband one, otherwise vice versa. It is also revealed that the effective interband coupling plays an important role in the intraband pairings, which is a distinct feature of the present two-band system.},

  Abstract                 = {Nematicity, defined as broken rotational symmetry, has recently been observed in competing phases proximate to the superconducting phase in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Similarly, the new iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition (i.e., a broken C4 symmetry) that either precedes or is coincident with a collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undoped parent compounds, and superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed via doping. Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of compounds has been reported by neutron scattering, scanning tunneling microscopy, and transport measurements. Here, we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of detwinned single crystals of a representative family of electron-doped iron-arsenide superconductors, Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 in the underdoped region. The crystals were detwinned via application of in-plane uniaxial stress, enabling measurements of single domain electronic structure in the orthorhombic state. At low temperatures, our results clearly demonstrate an in-plane electronic anisotropy characterized by a large energy splitting of two orthogonal bands with dominant dxz and dyz character, which is consistent with anisotropy observed by other probes. For compositions x > 0, for which the structural transition (TS) precedes the magnetic transition (TSDW), an anisotropic splitting is observed to develop above TSDW, indicating that it is specifically associated with TS. For unstressed crystals, the band splitting is observed close to TS, whereas for stressed crystals, the splitting is observed to considerably higher temperatures, revealing the presence of a surprisingly large in-plane nematic susceptibility in the electronic structure.},

  Abstract                 = {The coupling of Fe magnetic moments in LaFeAsO 1− x F x with the As A 1 g phonon is calculated. We present first-principles calculations of the atomic and electronic structure of LaFeAsO 1− x F x as a function of electron doping. We perform calculations using the virtual crystal approximation as well as supercells with F substitutional impurity atoms. The results validate the virtual crystal approximation for the electronic structure near the Fermi level. The electronic density of states at the Fermi level is maximum for x =0.125, enhancing the electron-phonon interaction. An additional increase of the electron-phonon parameter λ is obtained if the coupling between the A 1 g phonon and the Fe magnetic moment is included. It is found that the electron-phonon interaction can be one order of magnitude larger than its value if no spin resolution is included in the calculation.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the pairing symmetry in heavily overdoped Ba 1− x K x Fe 2 As 2 based on the spin-fluctuation mechanism. We propose a Fermi-patch mechanism that is different from the conventional Fermi-surface-nesting picture. The exotic octet nodes of the superconducting gap and the unusual evolution of the gap with doping observed by the recent experiments are well explained in a unified manner. We demonstrate that the scattering of electrons on the Fermi patches is mainly responsible for the incommensurate spin fluctuations and consequently the Fermi-surface-dependent multi-gap structure, since the Fermi level is close to the flat band. In addition, we find that a d -wave pairing state will prevail over the s -wave pairing state around the Lifshitz transition point.},

  Abstract                 = {The newly discovered iron-based high temperature superconductors have demonstrated rich physical properties. Here we give a brief review on the recent studies of the upper critical field and its anisotropy in a few typical series of the iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). In spite of their characters of a layered crystal structure, all the FeSCs possess an extremely large upper critical field and a weak anisotropy of superconductivity, being unique among the layered superconductors. These particular properties indicate potential applications of the FeSCs in the future. Based on the experimental facts of the FeSCs, we will discuss the possible mechanisms of pair breaking in high magnetic fields and its restrictions on the theoretical analysis of the superconducting pairing mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Abstract We study the interplay of fluctuations and superconductivity in BaFe2As2 (Ba‐122) compounds with Ba and Fe substituted by K (p doping) and Co (n doping), respectively. To this end, we measured electronic Raman spectra as a function of polarization and temperature. We observe gap excitations and fluctuations for all doping levels studied. The response from fluctuations is much stronger for Co substitution and, according to the selection rules and the temperature dependence, originates from the exchange of two critical spin fluctuations with characteristic wave vectors and . At 22\% K doping (), we find the same selection rules and spectral shape for the fluctuations but the intensity is smaller by a factor of 5. Since there exists no nematic region above the orthorhombic spin‐density‐wave (SDW) phase, the identification of the fluctuations via the temperature dependence is not possible. The gap excitations in the superconducting state indicate strongly anisotropic near‐nodal gaps for Co substitution which make the observation of collective modes difficult. The variation with doping of the spectral weights of the and gap features does not support the influence of fluctuations on Cooper pairing. Therefore, the observation of Bardasis–Schrieffer modes inside the nearly clean gaps on the K‐doped side remains the only experimental evidence for the relevance of fluctuations for pairing.},

  abstract = {FeSe is a fascinating superconducting material at the frontier of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we provide an overview of the current understanding of the electronic structure of FeSe, focusing in particular on its low-energy electronic structure as determined from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, quantum oscillations, and magnetotransport measurements of single-crystal samples. We discuss the unique place of FeSe among iron-based superconductors, as it is a multiband system exhibiting strong orbitally dependent electronic correlations and unusually small Fermi surfaces and is prone to different electronic instabilities. We pay particular attention to the evolution of the electronic structure that accompanies the tetragonal-orthorhombic structural distortion of the lattice around 90 K, which stabilizes a unique nematic electronic state. Finally, we discuss how the multiband multiorbital nematic electronic structure impacts our understanding of the superconductivity, and show that the tunability of the nematic state with chemical and physical pressure helps to disentangle the role of different competing interactions relevant for enhancing superconductivity.},

component in this system quickly reduces the spin density wave order and
favours the appearance of superconductivity, which is similar to what is seen in

  abstract  = {Previous study suggested that Se-site doping with Te or S in tetragonal FeSe adjusts the superconductivity only by expanding or compressing the lattice parameters. However, three chalcogens X (X = S, Se, Te) show different electronegativity, which could directly change the interaction between Fe & X, and their electronic structures. In order to understand this underlying mechanism, the samples with different anion compositions but the same lattice parameters are required. In this work, two superconductors: FeSe0.95Te0.03S0.02 and FeSe0.9Te0.057S0.043 have been synthesized by solid state reaction. The thus-obtained samples have the same lattice parameters in tetragonal single phase as that of undoped FeSe. It is found that despite the unchanged lattice, S/Te co-doping on Se-site still increased the density of the electronic states (DOS) near the Fermi level, thereby enhanced the superconductivity. Our results suggest that the influence of Se-site doping with the same valence chalcogen in superconducting FeSe is not simply in the view of the lattice size, effects on electronic structures originated from different electronegativity during Se-site doping should also be considered.},

The FeSe and related superconductors are currently receiving considerable attention for the high Tcs observed and for many similar features to the high Tc cuprate superconductors. These similarities suggest that understanding the FeSe based compounds could potentially help our understanding of the cuprates. We shall first review the common features observed in the FeSe-based system. It was found that with a careful control of material synthesizing processes, numerous rich phases have been observed in the FeSe-based system. Detailed studies show that the Fe-vacancy ordered phases found in the FeSe based compounds, which are non-superconducting Mott insulators, are the parent compounds of the superconductors. Superconductivity emerges from the parent phases by disordering the Fe vacancy order, often by a simple annealing treatment. Recent high temperature X-ray diffraction experiments show that the degree of structural distortion associated with the disorder of Fe-vacancy is closely related to volume fraction of the superconductivity observed. These results suggest the strong lattice to spin coupling are important for the occurrence of superconductivity in FeSe based superconductors.},

  abstract  = {To clarify the mechanism of superconductivity in iron-based superconductors, it is crucial to investigate FeSe1-xTex, which has the simplest crystal structure among them. There is, however, a serious obstacle to the understanding of its superconductivity; phase separation occurs in the region of 0.1<=x<=0.4, and thus a whole phase diagram has not been available. Here we report the successful fabrication of FeSe1-xTex films with 0<=x<=1. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the suppression of the phase separation. What is more notable is that a giant enhancement of Tc is observed in the {\textquotedblleft}phase-separation region.{\textquotedblright} The complete phase diagram that we present provides a previously unidentified perspective for the mechanism of superconductivity of this material.We demonstrate the successful fabrication on CaF2 substrates of FeSe1-xTex films with 0<=x<=1, including the region of 0.1<=x<=0.4, which is well known to be the {\textquotedblleft}phase-separation region,{\textquotedblright} via pulsed laser deposition that is a thermodynamically nonequilibrium method. In the resulting films, we observe a giant enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, in the region of 0.1<=x<=0.4: The maximum value reaches 23 K, which is \~{}1.5 times as large as the values reported for bulk samples of FeSe1-xTex. We present a complete phase diagram of FeSe1-xTex films. Surprisingly, a sudden suppression of Tc is observed at 0.1\&lt;x\&lt;0.2, whereas Tc increases with decreasing x for 0.2<=x\&lt;1. Namely, there is a clear difference between superconductivity realized in x=0-0.1 and in x>=0.2. To obtain a film of FeSe1-xTex with high Tc, the controls of the Te content x and the in-plane lattice strain are found to be key factors.},

While local distortions are present near superconducting onset in FeSe and FeSeTe, they seem to be absent in non superconducting FeTe. Of crucial importance is the variation of anion height. In FeSeTe, near the superconducting onset, the two heights,  and  show a nearly opposite behaviour. These changes indicate a possible correlation between Fe-chalcogen hybridization and the superconducting transition temperature in these Fe-chalcogenides.},

  abstract  = {The ternary iron chalcogenide, Fe1.03Se0.57Te0.43 is a member of the recently discovered family of Fe-based superconductors with an ambient pressure Tc of 13.9 K and a simple structure comprising layers of edge-sharing distorted Fe(Se/Te)4 tetrahedra separated by a van der Waals gap. Here we study the relationship between its structural and electronic responses to the application of pressure. Tc depends sensitively on applied pressure attaining a broad maximum of 23.3 K at ∼3 GPa. Further compression to 12 GPa leads to a metallic but nonsuperconducting ground state. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows that the superconducting phase is metrically orthorhombic at ambient pressure but pressurization to ∼3 GPa leads to a structural transformation to a more distorted structure with monoclinic symmetry. The exact coincidence of the crystal symmetry crossover pressure with that at which Tc is maximum reveals an intimate link between crystal and electronic structures of the iron chalcogenide superconductors.},

  abstract  = {A comprehensive first principles study on the electronic topological transition in a number of 122 family of Fe based superconductors is presented. Doping as well as temperature driven Lifshitz transitions are predicted from ab-initio simulations in a variety of Fe based superconductors that are consistent with experimental findings. In all the studied compounds the Lifshitz transitions are consistently found to take place at a doping concentration just around where superconductivity is known to acquire the highest Tc and magnetism disappears. This indicates the intriguing heed to the inter-relationship between superconductivity and Lifshitz transition in Fe-based 122 materials. Systematically, the Lifshitz transition occurs (above certain threshold doping) in some of the electronic Fermi surfaces for hole doped 122 compounds, whereas in hole Fermi surfaces for electron as well as iso-electronic doped 122 compounds. Temperature driven Lifshitz transition is found to occur in the iso-electronic Ru-doped BaFe2As2 compounds. A systematic study of Fermi surface area e.g., variations of (i) areas of each individual Fermi surfaces, (ii) sum total areas of all the electron Fermi Surfaces, (iii) sum total areas of all the hole Fermi Surfaces, (iv) sum total areas of all the five Fermi Surfaces, (v) difference of all hole and all electron Fermi surface areas as a function of doping is a rare wealth of information that can be verified by the de Haas-van Alphen and allied effects (i.e. , Shubnikov-de Haas effect) are presented. Fermi surface area are found to carry sensitivity of topological modifications more acutely than the band structures and can be used as a better experimental tool to identify ETT/LT.},

Our calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) with local density approximation (LDA+U) framework employed in TB-LMTO ASA code. We found the correlation effects are orbital selective due to the strength of interorbital hybridization among the different Fe-3d orbitals mediated via the chalcogen (Se/Te-p) orbitals and are different in both the compounds. The Coulomb interaction is screened significantly by Te-p bands in FeTe. Similarly the orbital selection is different in both the compounds because of the difference in the chalcogen height.},

  abstract  = {Whether a quantum critical point (QCP) lies beneath the superconducting dome has been a long-standing issue that remains unresolved in many classes of unconventional superconductors, notably cuprates, heavy fermions, and, most recently, iron pnictides. The existence of a QCP may offer a route to understanding the origin of unconventional superconductors’ anomalous non-Fermi liquid properties, the microscopic coexistence between unconventional superconductivity and magnetic or some other exotic order, and, ultimately, the mechanism of superconductivity itself. The isovalent substituted iron pnictide BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 offers a new platform for the study of quantum criticality, providing a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the electronic properties in a wide range of the phase diagram. Recent experiments in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 have provided the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a second-order quantum phase transition lying beneath the superconducting dome.},
